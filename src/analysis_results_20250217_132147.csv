```","1. **CATEGROY_2**
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Category 2 description.
   - **Data type issues**: Typographical error in the column name (""CATEGROY_2"" instead of ""CATEGORY_2"").
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: There is no direct issue with values themselves; the inconsistency is in the typo within the column name.
   - **Recommended improvements**: Correct the column name to ""CATEGORY_2"" for accurate representation.

2. **CURRENT_FISC_PER** 
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Current fiscal period identifier.
   - **Data type issues**: Current data type is ""NUMBER""; however, if it represents a period or a concatenated string of year and month, a more descriptive format like ""VARCHAR"" might be more suitable if the fiscal period is not strictly numerical.
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: The value ""2018012"" appears as a long number, which might be meaningful as a VARCHAR if it's a formatted identifier.
   - **Recommended improvements**: Consider using a textual format like ""VARCHAR"" if it includes non-numeric formatting, or add metadata to explain the structure.

3. **SLS_OFC_CV_CD**
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Sales office CV code.
   - **Data type issues**: Defined as ""NUMBER"", but in records like ""T42-Auchan"", it appears to hold alphanumeric values, which should be ""TEXT"".
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: ""T42-Auchan"".
   - **Recommended improvements**: Change data type to ""TEXT"" to align with the data format.

4. **SLS_OFC_CY**
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Sales office country.
   - **Data type issues**: No discrepancies in data type; however, consistency in case format could be maintained to ensure uniformity.
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: Some entries have mixed casing, such as ""South Korea"" versus all uppercase or lowercase.
   - **Recommended improvements**: Standardize text casing across entries for consistency.

5. **PROD_HIER_L9**
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Product hierarchy level 9.
   - **Data type issues**: Some entries exceed practical length, possibly leading to data truncation or readability issues.
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: Values like ""Listerine TTC GumCareMild 750ml KR 23GD+ - 8801008006221"" appear lengthy.
   - **Recommended improvements**: Consider enforcing a reasonable character limit.

6. **TOT_INVC_VAL**
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Total invoice value.
   - **Data type issues**: The presence of large negative values could indicate incorrect data if not expected.
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: Values like ""-12059.0"" and ""-6354.0"".
   - **Recommended improvements**: Validate the business context to ensure negative totals are expected; otherwise, correct them. Use constraints or validation to ensure value consistency.

7. **TOT_INVC_QTY**
   - **Current semantic meaning**: Total invoice quantity.
   - **Data type issues**: Negative quantities might not be intended in the dataset.
   - **Example of inconsistent values**: Values like ""-1.0"" and ""-80.0"".
   - **Recommended improvements**: Review and enforce business rules to handle negative quantities unless valid cases are determined.

By addressing these issues, improvements in data integrity, usability, and consistency are achieved, ensuring the dataset adheres to business logic and domain semantics."
