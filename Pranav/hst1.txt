SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_SUMMARY_MONTHLY:
solution:
- Correct the 'category_depth3' to include a valid subcategory, or if it is truly 'None', confirm that it is intended and document the exception.
- Verify 'ranking' value for correctness as it seems unusually high for a 'jnj_product_flag' marked 'Y' or ensure it falls within the acceptable range.
- Update 'run_id' to a valid positive integer, as '-49' appears to be an invalid value for this field.
- Ensure 'yearmo' is formatted correctly and falls within the expected range, as '202349' seems to be incorrect.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_SUMMARY_MONTHLY
WHERE category_depth3 IS NULL 
   OR NOT jnj_product_flag IN ('Y', 'N') 
   OR ranking < 1 
   OR run_id < 0 
   OR yearmo NOT BETWEEN 202301 AND 202312;

SQL Query to check for anomalies in the 'DAILYSALES' table:
sql
-- This query is a template to check for common anomalies, you can customize it based on specific anomaly criteria
WITH sales_data AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        LAG(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS previous_sales,
        LEAD(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sales_date) AS next_sales
    FROM DAILYSALES
)
SELECT 
    *
FROM sales_data
WHERE 
    sales_amount < 0 -- Check for negative sales
    OR sales_amount > 1000000 -- Check for unusually high sales
    OR (sales_amount > previous_sales * 2 AND previous_sales IS NOT NULL) -- Check for sudden spikes
    OR (sales_amount < previous_sales / 2 AND previous_sales IS NOT NULL) -- Check for sudden drops;


This query is a generic template to detect potential anomalies by looking for negative sales amounts, unusually high sales amounts, and sudden spikes or drops compared to the previous sales data. Adjust the conditions based on the specific business rules and thresholds relevant to your dataset.
