Since no anomalies were detected in the table 'DAILYSALES', there are no specific solutions to provide. However, I can help you with a Snowflake-friendly SQL query template to detect potential anomalies in a sales table for future use:

sql
-- SQL Query to detect anomalies in a sales table
SELECT 
    DATE,
    SALES_AMOUNT,
    AVG(SALES_AMOUNT) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', DATE)) AS AVG_MONTHLY_SALES,
    CASE 
        WHEN SALES_AMOUNT > 1.5 * AVG(SALES_AMOUNT) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', DATE)) THEN 'High Anomaly'
        WHEN SALES_AMOUNT < 0.5 * AVG(SALES_AMOUNT) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', DATE)) THEN 'Low Anomaly'
        ELSE 'No Anomaly'
    END AS ANOMALY_DETECTION
FROM 
    DAILYSALES
ORDER BY 
    DATE;


This query uses window functions to calculate the average sales for each month and then compares each day's sales to identify anomalies that are significantly higher or lower than the average. Adjust the thresholds (1.5 and 0.5 in this example) as needed to suit your specific requirements.
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES
solution: Verify and correct the 'saldlvdate' to ensure it is not earlier than 'salinvdate', as the delivery date should not precede the invoice date.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES
WHERE saldlvdate < salinvdate;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_CLAVIS_GB_PRODUCTS
solution : The detected anomaly appears to involve a mismatch or inconsistency in the product description fields (e.g., `product_desc`, `url`, `product_image_url`) and potential numerical inconsistencies or errors (e.g., negative values in milestone comparisons, which might not make sense). To resolve the issue, review and correct the product description fields for accurate and consistent information. Additionally, check the milestone comparison fields to ensure logical and accurate values that reflect the intended comparisons.

SQL Query to detect anomalies:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_CLAVIS_GB_PRODUCTS
WHERE (product_desc LIKE '%Another Different%' OR url LIKE '%anotherdifferenturl.com%' OR product_image_url LIKE '%anotherdifferentimageurl.com%')
   OR (milestone1_comp < 0 OR milestone3_comp < 0 OR milestone5_comp < 0 OR milestone7_comp < 0 OR milestone9_comp < 0);
Table Name: SDL_ID_POS_IDM_SELLOUT  
Solution: The anomaly detected is due to an illogical `YEARMONTH` value, `202349`, which does not correspond to any valid year-month format. To address this issue, you should verify the data entry process to ensure that only valid year-month combinations (e.g., `YYYYMM` where MM is between 01 and 12) are allowed. Correct the erroneous entry in the dataset and implement validation checks to prevent similar issues in the future.

Snowflake-compatible SQL query to identify these anomalies:

sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_ID_POS_IDM_SELLOUT
WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(yearmonth, '^(20[0-9]{2}(0[1-9]|1[0-2]))$');


This query retrieves records where the `yearmonth` column does not match the expected pattern of `YYYYMM` for valid year-month combinations.
table_name: SDL_MDS_PH_NPI_PEG_ITEM  
solution: Update the 'id' to a valid positive integer value, set 'salescycle' to a valid positive integer, and ensure 'changetrackingmask' is a non-negative integer.  

SQL query: 
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_PH_NPI_PEG_ITEM
WHERE id < 0 OR salescycle < 0 OR changetrackingmask < 0;
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_POS_PRODUCTS  
solution : Remove the row with id -1 as it contains invalid data including a negative changetrackingmask value and a potentially duplicated muid.  

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_POS_PRODUCTS 
WHERE id = -1 
   OR changetrackingmask < 0 
   OR muid IN (
       SELECT muid 
       FROM SDL_MDS_VN_POS_PRODUCTS 
       GROUP BY muid 
       HAVING COUNT(muid) > 1
   );
==================================================================================table_name : SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
solution : No action needed as there are no anomalies detected.

SQL Query:
sql
-- No anomalies were detected, so no specific query is needed. 
-- However, if you want to continuously monitor the table for any potential future anomalies, you could use a template like the following:

SELECT *
FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
WHERE <condition to detect anomalies>;

Note: Replace `<condition to detect anomalies>` with the specific conditions that would indicate an anomaly in your context.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_CSL_RDSSMWEEKLYTARGET_OUTPUT  
solution : Review and correct the negative and missing values for 'distcode', 'targetrefno', 'smcode', 'smname', 'rmcode', 'rmname', 'targetyear', 'targetmonth', 'targetvalue', 'targetname', 'week1', 'week2', 'week3', 'week4', 'week5', 'targetstatus', 'targettype', and 'downloadstatus'. Ensure 'targetyear' is a positive value and 'targetvalue' along with weekly values are non-negative. Update missing 'createddate', 'run_id', 'crt_dttm', and 'file_name' if applicable.

SQL Query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_CSL_RDSSMWEEKLYTARGET_OUTPUT
WHERE 
    distcode IS NULL OR
    targetrefno IS NULL OR
    targetyear < 0 OR
    targetmonth IS NULL OR
    targetvalue < 0 OR
    week1 < 0 OR
    week2 < 0 OR
    week3 < 0 OR
    week4 < 0 OR
    week5 < 0 OR
    targetstatus IS NULL OR
    targettype IS NULL OR
    downloadstatus IS NULL OR
    smcode IS NULL OR
    smname IS NULL OR
    rmcode IS NULL OR
    rmname IS NULL OR

    run_id < 0 OR
    crt_dttm IS NULL OR
    file_name IS NULL;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_JNJ_CONSUMERREACH_CVS
solution : Update the 'retailname' field in the anomalous row where it is detected as 'None' with the correct retail name, or ensure that it is set to a valid placeholder such as 'Unknown'. Additionally, check other fields for consistency and accuracy against the expected data standards.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_JNJ_CONSUMERREACH_CVS
WHERE retailname IS NULL OR retailname = 'None';
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_MY_PRODUCT_MASTER
solution : No action needed as no anomalies were detected.
SQL query : -- No specific query needed as there are no anomalies detected in this table.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_PACIFIC_ACCT_NIELSENCODE_MAPPING  
solution : The anomaly detected is the presence of a negative value in the 'id' field. Ensure that the 'id' field only contains positive integers. Update the row to correct the 'id' value to a valid positive integer.

SQL query: 
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_PACIFIC_ACCT_NIELSENCODE_MAPPING 
WHERE id < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
solution: The anomaly detected is the negative 'versionnumber' (-32) and 'changetrackingmask' (-245). Correct these values to positive integers that align with the logical sequence of the dataset.


SQL Query to find anomalies in Snowflake:

sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
WHERE versionnumber < 0
   OR changetrackingmask < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_ID_POS_CARREFOUR_STOCK
solution : Investigate why the `stock_amt` is negative. Verify if there was a data entry error or if a return/discount is incorrectly recorded. Correct the `stock_amt` to reflect the accurate value. 

SQL query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_ID_POS_CARREFOUR_STOCK
WHERE stock_amt < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_PH_MSL_DTLS
solution : The anomalous row with id '50' has inconsistent data, possibly due to incorrect 'versionnumber' and 'version_id' values. Ensure that these fields are updated to reflect the correct version information. Moreover, verify the 'lastchgdatetime' and 'lastchgusername' to ensure they are accurate and align with the 'enterdatetime' and 'enterusername' for consistency. Perform data validation checks to maintain data integrity.

-- Snowflake SQL query to find anomalies in the table
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_PH_MSL_DTLS 
WHERE versionnumber <> version_id
   OR lastchgdatetime < enterdatetime
   OR lastchgusername = enterusername;
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_MDS_PH_NON_ISE_WEIGHTS
solution: The anomaly in the dataset is the presence of a negative weight value (-10.0), which is likely incorrect. Ensure that weights are non-negative and review the process that led to this entry. Correct the weight value to an appropriate non-negative figure.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_PH_NON_ISE_WEIGHTS
WHERE weight < 0;
==================================================================================
Based on the provided information, no specific anomalies were detected. However, to adhere to your request, I will provide a sample response format with a placeholder for the solution and SQL query, assuming hypothetical scenarios where anomalies might have been detected.


table_name : SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_MASTER
solution : No anomalies detected in this table.

-- Snowflake SQL query to check for anomalies like null values or duplicates in a hypothetical scenario:
SELECT PRODUCT_ID, COUNT(*)
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_MASTER
GROUP BY PRODUCT_ID
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
OR COUNT(*) IS NULL;


If you have specific anomalies detected in other tables, please provide details, and I'll generate a specific solution and SQL query accordingly.
==================================================================================
table_name: PRODBU_PRODUCTBUSINESSUNIT  
solution: Review and correct the 'islisted' value for the product 'PBUID010' as it should be consistent with business rules. Ensure 'islisted' aligns with the product availability status in the system.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM PRODBU_PRODUCTBUSINESSUNIT
WHERE islisted NOT IN ('Yes', 'No');
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_ECOM_GMV_KONVY
solution : Investigate the row with unusually high values for sales_amount, total_unit_sold, tstock, current_price, pro_price, pro_cost, cost_in_vat, cost, and market_value. Verify the source data for potential errors or misreported figures. If these are errors, correct the values to reflect accurate data. Also, review the 'infinite' and 'None' entries in the columns tstock, stock_turnover_days, and status. Ensure all entries conform to expected data types and ranges.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_ECOM_GMV_KONVY
WHERE sales_amount > 1000000000
   OR total_unit_sold > 1000000000
   OR tstock = 'infinite'

   OR stock_turnover_days = 9999
   OR view_no = 'infinite'
   OR conversion = 9999999999
   OR status IS NULL
   OR platform IS NULL;
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_CSL_UDCMASTER  
solution: The anomalies in the 'SDL_CSL_UDCMASTER' table seem to be related to invalid data values. Specifically, the 'columnprecision' and 'columnmandatory' columns contain negative values, which are typically not valid for these fields. Ensure that 'columnprecision' has a non-negative integer value and 'columnmandatory' should be either 0 (not mandatory) or 1 (mandatory). Review and correct these values in the dataset.

SQL Query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_CSL_UDCMASTER
WHERE columnprecision < 0 OR columnmandatory NOT IN (0, 1);
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_INVOICE  
solution : Ensure that the table 'SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_INVOICE' has columns with numeric data types (such as INT, FLOAT, or DECIMAL) that are appropriately populated. Check for columns that are expected to have numeric values but contain NULLs or non-numeric data, and correct these entries. Consider adding data validation rules to prevent future non-numeric entries.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_INVOICE
WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER(<numeric_column>) IS NULL OR <numeric_column> IS NULL;

Replace `<numeric_column>` with the actual column names expected to contain numeric data. This query will help identify rows where numeric conversion fails or values are missing.
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_HK_IMS_VIVA_SEL_OUT
solution: Correct the negative values for 'sales_volume', 'sales_order_quantity', 'net_trade_sales', and 'local_curr_exch_rate'. Ensure these fields have positive values where applicable. Verify the 'transactiontype' and 'return_reason' for accuracy and consistency with sales data.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_HK_IMS_VIVA_SEL_OUT
WHERE sales_volume < 0
   OR sales_order_quantity < 0
   OR net_trade_sales < 0
   OR local_curr_exch_rate < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_KR_COUPANG_PA_REPORT  
solution : Ensure that the table 'SDL_KR_COUPANG_PA_REPORT' contains numeric columns required for anomaly detection. Identify the necessary numeric fields and populate them with valid data. Review the data source and ETL processes to guarantee that numeric data is correctly ingested and transformed.

SQL query:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_PA_REPORT
WHERE 1 = 0


The query serves as a placeholder to check the structure and schema of the table. You should tailor it to detect missing numeric data by identifying columns expected to have numeric data but currently do not. You can adapt the query based on the actual column names and expected data types.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT  
solution : Ensure that all necessary numeric fields in the table 'SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT' are properly populated with valid data. Check for missing or null values in numeric columns and update them with default values or recalculate if possible. If the data source is external, verify the data extraction and loading process to ensure numeric data is being captured correctly.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT
WHERE 
    <numeric_column_1> IS NULL 
    OR <numeric_column_2> IS NULL 
    OR <numeric_column_3> IS NULL;

Replace `<numeric_column_1>`, `<numeric_column_2>`, `<numeric_column_3>`, etc., with the actual numeric column names in the table to identify rows with missing numeric data.
==================================================================================

==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_SUMMARY_MONTHLY
solution : Correct the negative values in the 'run_id' and 'yearmo' columns. Replace the erroneous 'run_id' with a valid positive integer and ensure 'yearmo' is in a proper YYYYMM format.


SQL Query to find anomalies:

sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_SUMMARY_MONTHLY
WHERE run_id < 0 OR CHAR_LENGTH(yearmo) != 6 OR NOT yearmo LIKE '20__%'
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_LA_GT_SELLOUT_FACT   
solution : The anomaly in this table is a negative gross price of -100.0. Verify and correct the gross price to ensure it is a positive value and accurately reflects the transaction.

SQL query to find anomalies more efficiently:
sql
SELECT * FROM SDL_LA_GT_SELLOUT_FACT
WHERE grossprice < 0;
==================================================================================
There are no anomalies detected in the provided table, so there is no solution needed. However, I will provide a template for future use in case anomalies are detected:


table_name : SDL_MDS_PH_LAV_CUSTOMER
solution : No anomalies detected. No solution required.

-- SQL Query Template for anomaly detection (Snowflake friendly)
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_PH_LAV_CUSTOMER
WHERE <condition_to_identify_anomalies>;


Replace `<condition_to_identify_anomalies>` with the actual condition to identify anomalies when they are detected.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_PH_LAV_PRODUCT
solution : The anomaly in the dataset was detected in the 'promoendperiod' field, which has an earlier period (2023-18) compared to 'promostartperiod' (2023-19). Adjust the 'promoendperiod' to be a period later than or equal to 'promostartperiod'.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_PH_LAV_PRODUCT

table_name : SDL_IG_INVENTORY_DATA  
solution : Ensure that the columns intended to store numeric data are correctly defined with numeric data types. Verify that the data being inserted into these columns is numeric and correct any entries that are not. Implement data validation checks during data entry to prevent non-numeric data from being inserted.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_IG_INVENTORY_DATA
WHERE TRY_CAST(<numeric_column_name> AS NUMBER) IS NULL;

Replace `<numeric_column_name>` with the actual column names that are supposed to store numeric data. This query will help identify rows where the data cannot be cast to a number, indicating potential anomalies.
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_HK_IMS_WINGKEUNG_SEL_OUT  
solution: The anomaly is due to a negative value in the 'sales_order_quantity' field. Verify the data entry process for sales orders to ensure quantities cannot be negative and rectify the negative entry for this specific record. Validate the associated transaction details to confirm if it's a data entry error or an actual return. Adjust the 'sales_order_quantity' to reflect the correct value.

SQL Query:  
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_HK_IMS_WINGKEUNG_SEL_OUT 
WHERE sales_order_quantity < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_ID_POS_IDM_SELLOUT
solution: Correct the 'yearmonth' value from '202349' to a valid format such as 'YYYYMM', e.g., '202304' for April 2023.

SQL query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_ID_POS_IDM_SELLOUT
WHERE LENGTH(yearmonth) != 6 OR yearmonth NOT LIKE '20%'
==================================================================================
Certainly! Here's the solution for the detected anomaly in the 'CUST_CUSTOMER' table:


table_name : CUST_CUSTOMER
solution : Correct the 'fetchedsequence' value from '-49' to a valid positive integer, as negative sequence numbers are not logical for sequence tracking.


And here's a Snowflake-friendly SQL query to detect similar anomalies in the dataset:

sql
SELECT *
FROM CUST_CUSTOMER
WHERE fetchedsequence < 0;


This query will help identify rows where the `fetchedsequence` has a negative value, which is considered an anomaly for sequence tracking.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_CHW_ECOMM_DATA  
solution : Ensure that the columns intended to store numeric data are properly defined with numeric data types, such as INTEGER or FLOAT, and validate the data being inserted to ensure it is numeric.

==================================================================================
Since no anomalies were detected in the table 'SDL_CSL_PRODUCTWISESTOCK', here's the response:


table_name : SDL_CSL_PRODUCTWISESTOCK
solution : No action required as no anomalies were detected.


To efficiently check for anomalies in the future, you can use a query to look for common issues such as NULL values, duplicates, or data type mismatches. Here's an example query that checks for these anomalies:

sql
-- Check for NULL values in important columns
SELECT *
FROM SDL_CSL_PRODUCTWISESTOCK
WHERE important_column1 IS NULL
   OR important_column2 IS NULL;

-- Check for duplicate entries based on a unique identifier
SELECT product_id, COUNT(*)
FROM SDL_CSL_PRODUCTWISESTOCK
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check for data type mismatches or out-of-range values
-- Assuming 'quantity' should be a non-negative integer
SELECT *
FROM SDL_CSL_PRODUCTWISESTOCK
WHERE quantity < 0
   OR quantity != FLOOR(quantity);


Please customize the column names (`important_column1`, `important_column2`, `product_id`, `quantity`) based on your actual table schema.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_KR_BO_YOUNG_JONG_HAP_LOGISTICS_GT_SELLOUT

    AND data_type IN ('NUMBER', 'INTEGER', 'FLOAT', 'DECIMAL')
    AND column_name NOT IN (
        SELECT 
            column_name 
        FROM 
            SDL_KR_BO_YOUNG_JONG_HAP_LOGISTICS_GT_SELLOUT 
        WHERE 
            column_name IS NOT NULL
    );
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_DAILYSALES_DEL  
solution: Ensure that all monetary values (such as salgrossamt, salnetamt, prdgrossamt, etc.) are positive or zero, as negative values might indicate errors. Validate that prdqty and prdfreeqty are non-negative. Check for logical consistency between related columns, for example, prdselratebeforetax should be less than or equal to prdselrateaftertax. Investigate and correct any negative values for mrp and ensure salinvdate and saldlvdate are correct and not indicative of data entry errors. Ensure that the sum of discounts and deductions does not exceed the gross amount.  

SQL Query to find anomalies:

sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_DAILYSALES_DEL
WHERE salgrossamt < 0
   OR salnetamt < 0
   OR prdgrossamt < 0
   OR prdqty < 0
   OR prdfreeqty < 0
   OR prdselratebeforetax < 0
   OR prdselratebeforetax > prdselrateaftertax
   OR mrp < 0
   OR salinvdate > CURRENT_DATE()
   OR saldlvdate > CURRENT_DATE()
   OR (salgrossamt - (salspldiscamt + salschdiscamt + salcashdiscamt + saldbdiscamt + salinvleveldiscamt)) < 0;

GROUP BY 
    column_name;

-- Check for duplicate rows
SELECT 
    column1, column2, ..., columnN, -- Replace with actual column names
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM 
    <your_table_name>
GROUP BY 
    column1, column2, ..., columnN
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check for outliers using a simple statistical method (e.g., Z-score)
SELECT 
    *,
    (column_name - AVG(column_name) OVER ()) / STDDEV(column_name) OVER () AS z_score
FROM 
    <your_table_name>
HAVING 
    ABS(z_score) > 3; -- Adjust the threshold as needed

Since there are no anomalies detected in the table 'SDL_KR_COUPANG_BRAND_RANKING', no specific solutions are required for this table. However, I can provide you with a template for how to format your solutions and a sample SQL query that can be used to identify anomalies in general.

**Template for Solutions:**


table_name : <table name>
solution : <solution>


**Sample SQL Query for Anomaly Detection:**

To proactively find anomalies in a table, you might look for things like null values in critical columns, duplicate entries, or outliers in numerical data. Here's a generic SQL query template to identify such issues:

sql
-- Example query to find anomalies: Duplicate entries and null values
SELECT 
    <primary_key_column>, COUNT(*)
FROM 
    <your_table_name>
GROUP BY 
    <primary_key_column>
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1;

SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    <your_table_name>
WHERE 
    <important_column> IS NULL;

-- Example query to find numerical outliers
SELECT 
    <numerical_column>
FROM 
    <your_table_name>
WHERE 
    <numerical_column> > (SELECT AVG(<numerical_column>) + 3 * STDDEV(<numerical_column>) FROM <your_table_name>)
    OR 
    <numerical_column> < (SELECT AVG(<numerical_column>) - 3 * STDDEV(<numerical_column>) FROM <your_table_name>);


Replace `<your_table_name>`, `<primary_key_column>`, `<important_column>`, and `<numerical_column>` with the appropriate column names for your specific table. This template can help in identifying typical anomalies in a Snowflake-friendly manner.
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCTSALEREPORT
solution: The anomaly in the dataset is the negative value in the 'cost_of_purchase' column. This should be corrected to a non-negative value. Verify the correct cost of purchase for the relevant product and update the entry. Additionally, check for any data entry errors or discrepancies in the source file 'report48.csv' and ensure that all future entries are validated before uploading.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCTSALEREPORT
WHERE cost_of_purchase < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_ECOMMERCE_6PAI  
solution: The negative value for 'plan' in 'Sales Growth' suggests a data entry error. Verify the data source for accuracy, correct the entry for 'plan' to reflect a realistic positive number, and re-evaluate the 'score_weighted' and 'score_non_weighted' calculations.  

SQL Query: 
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_ECOMMERCE_6PAI
WHERE plan < 0
   OR score_weighted < 0
   OR score_non_weighted < 0
   OR gap_vs_pm < 0
   OR gap_vs_p3m < 0
   OR gap_vs_plan < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_ECOM_NTS  
solution : The anomaly is in the 'year' column, where the value '10000' is outside a realistic range. Update the 'year' to a valid year based on business rules or data correction, such as changing it to '2023'.

SQL Query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_ECOM_NTS
WHERE year > 2100 OR year < 1900;
==================================================================================
table_name : KPI2DATA_MAPPING  
solution : Add numeric columns to the table or ensure existing columns contain numeric data to enable anomaly detection.

SQL Query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT *
FROM KPI2DATA_MAPPING
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'KPI2DATA_MAPPING' 
    AND DATA_TYPE IN ('NUMBER', 'FLOAT', 'INTEGER', 'DECIMAL')
);
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_CSL_TBL_SCHEMEWISE_APNO
solution : No solution required as no anomalies were detected.

SQL Query to find anomalies:
sql
-- Assuming anomalies might involve data types, null values, or unexpected data ranges. 
-- Here's a general query to check for potential issues:

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    SUM(CASE WHEN <column_name> IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_values,
    SUM(CASE WHEN <column_name> NOT BETWEEN <min_value> AND <max_value> THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS out_of_range_values
FROM 
    SDL_CSL_TBL_SCHEMEWISE_APNO;


Replace `<column_name>`, `<min_value>`, and `<max_value>` with the actual column name and acceptable range to tailor the query to specific potential anomalies.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_POP6_SG_EXECUTED_VISITS
solution : Correct the longitude and latitude values to fall within valid ranges: longitude (-180 to 180) and latitude (-90 to 90). Ensure that the planned_visit and cancelled_visit fields contain valid boolean or integer values representing true/false or 1/0. Review the logic for these fields if needed.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_POP6_SG_EXECUTED_VISITS
WHERE (check_in_longitude < -180 OR check_in_longitude > 180
       OR check_in_latitude < -90 OR check_in_latitude > 90
       OR check_out_longitude < -180 OR check_out_longitude > 180
       OR check_out_latitude < -90 OR check_out_latitude > 90)
OR (planned_visit NOT IN (0, 1) OR cancelled_visit NOT IN (0, 1));
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_MDS_MY_CUSTOMER_HIERARCHY  
solution: Ensure that the table 'SDL_MDS_MY_CUSTOMER_HIERARCHY' includes numeric columns needed for anomaly detection. Review the data model and add any necessary numeric fields that are missing, such as sales figures or customer metrics.

SQL query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'SDL_MDS_MY_CUSTOMER_HIERARCHY'
AND DATA_TYPE NOT IN ('NUMBER', 'INTEGER', 'FLOAT', 'DECIMAL');
==================================================================================
Certainly, here is the solution following the specified format:


table_name: SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_USER_MASTER
solution: Review and correct the 'run_id' value, which is invalid as it is negative. Ensure that the 'cdl_dttm' is not set to a future date as it appears to be set to a date in 2025, which could be incorrect unless intended.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_USER_MASTER
WHERE run_id < 0 OR cdl_dttm > CURRENT_DATE;


This query will help identify rows with negative 'run_id' values or 'cdl_dttm' set to a date later than the current date, which could indicate data entry errors or inconsistencies.
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_MY_CIW_MAP  
solution: Ensure that the columns intended for numeric data types are correctly defined and populated with numeric values. Validate data input to prevent non-numeric entries in these columns.

SQL query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MY_CIW_MAP
WHERE TRY_CAST(<numeric_column> AS NUMBER) IS NULL;


(Note: Replace `<numeric_column>` with the actual column name intended to hold numeric values.)
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_JNJ_OSA_OOS_REPORT  
solution : Correct the 'yearmo' field to the appropriate year and month format (e.g., 202301 instead of 202702) for the anomalous row.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_JNJ_OSA_OOS_REPORT
WHERE LENGTH(yearmo) != 6 OR LEFT(yearmo, 4) NOT BETWEEN '2000' AND '2099';
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_PS_WEIGHTS
solution : Correct the 'versionnumber' to a positive integer value as negative version numbers are likely unintended.


sql
-- SQL query to find anomalies in the SDL_MDS_VN_PS_WEIGHTS table
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_PS_WEIGHTS
WHERE versionnumber < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_DSTR_COLES_INV  
solution : Ensure that numeric columns in the table 'SDL_DSTR_COLES_INV' are populated with valid numeric data. Check for any NULL values or data type mismatches and correct them.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_DSTR_COLES_INV
WHERE TRY_CAST(<numeric_column_name> AS NUMBER) IS NULL;


Replace `<numeric_column_name>` with the actual name of the numeric column you need to check for anomalies. This query will help you identify rows where the supposed numeric column contains non-numeric data or is NULL.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_CUSTOMER_DIM_ADFTEMP
solution : Ensure that the table 'SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_CUSTOMER_DIM_ADFTEMP' contains at least one column with numeric data types (e.g., INTEGER, FLOAT, DECIMAL) that can be used for anomaly detection. If no such column exists, consider adding a derived numeric column or transforming existing data to a numeric format.

SQL Query:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_CUSTOMER_DIM_ADFTEMP'
AND data_type IN ('NUMBER', 'INTEGER', 'FLOAT', 'DECIMAL', 'DOUBLE');
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_ECOM_TARGET  
solution : The anomaly detected in the dataset appears to be related to the consistency of the 'versionname', 'versionnumber', 'version_id', and 'versionflag' fields. Ensure that these fields have consistent naming conventions and values across similar entries to maintain data integrity. Verify and correct the data entry for 'versionname', 'versionnumber', 'version_id', and 'versionflag' for row with id 50.

SQL Query to find anomalies:

sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_ECOM_TARGET
WHERE versionname NOT LIKE 'Alpha%' 
   OR versionnumber != version_id 
   OR versionflag NOT LIKE 'Flag%'
   OR name NOT LIKE 'Item%' 
   OR code NOT LIKE 'Code%' 
   OR changetrackingmask::TEXT != CAST(versionnumber AS TEXT);


This query checks for inconsistencies in the naming patterns for 'versionname', 'versionflag', 'name', and 'code', as well as mismatches between 'versionnumber' and 'version_id', and between 'changetrackingmask' and 'versionnumber'. Adjust the conditions based on the specific anomaly patterns identified.
==================================================================================
Certainly, here's the solution and the SQL query for detecting anomalies in the `MRCHR_MERCHANDISINGRESPONSE` table.

table_name : MRCHR_MERCHANDISINGRESPONSE  
solution : The anomaly in the dataset is that the `enddate` and `endtime` are earlier than the `startdate` and `starttime`. Ensure that the `enddate` and `endtime` are corrected to be after the `startdate` and `starttime`.

Here is a Snowflake-friendly SQL query to detect such anomalies:

sql
SELECT * 
FROM MRCHR_MERCHANDISINGRESPONSE
WHERE (enddate < startdate) 
   OR (enddate = startdate AND endtime < starttime);


This query will help identify rows where the end date and time precede the start date and time.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_TOPDOOR_STORETYPE_MAPPING  
solution : Correct the negative value in the 'changetrackingmask' column for the anomalous row by updating it to an appropriate positive value that aligns with the intended tracking logic.

sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_TOPDOOR_STORETYPE_MAPPING
WHERE changetrackingmask < 0;
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_RANKING_WEEKLY  
solution : Ensure that the table 'SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_RANKING_WEEKLY' contains numeric columns necessary for anomaly detection. Consider adding or correcting columns to store numeric data like 'ranking_score', 'sales_volume', or any other metrics relevant for anomaly detection.

SQL Query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'SDL_KR_COUPANG_PRODUCT_RANKING_WEEKLY'
AND data_type NOT IN ('NUMBER', 'INTEGER', 'FLOAT', 'DOUBLE')
AND table_schema = 'YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME';

Replace 'YOUR_SCHEMA_NAME' with the actual schema name where the table resides. This query lists columns that are not numeric, indicating which might need adjustment or the addition of numeric data for proper anomaly detection.
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_ALLCHANNEL_SISO_TARGET_SKU  
solution : Ensure that the columns intended for numeric data are correctly defined with an appropriate numeric data type. Check for any columns that may have been incorrectly set to a non-numeric data type and alter them as necessary. Additionally, verify that the data being inserted into these columns is valid numeric data.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'SDL_MDS_VN_ALLCHANNEL_SISO_TARGET_SKU'
AND data_type NOT IN ('NUMBER', 'FLOAT', 'INTEGER', 'DOUBLE', 'DECIMAL');

This query helps identify which columns are not set to a numeric type, allowing you to pinpoint potential sources of the anomaly.
==================================================================================
table_name: SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_LISTS_PRODUCTS
solution: Verify the integrity of the product_list_code and ensure it matches expected patterns or values for 'Code11'. Check the msl_ranking field for consistency with other entries and adjust if necessary. Confirm the associated date 'prod_grp_date' is correct and matches historical data patterns. Validate the data entry timestamp 'crtd_dttm' to ensure it aligns with the intended data entry schedule. Recalculate or verify the hashkey 'hash11' for data integrity.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_LISTS_PRODUCTS
WHERE product_list_code = 'Code11'
AND (msl_ranking IS NULL OR msl_ranking NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT msl_ranking FROM SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_LISTS_PRODUCTS WHERE product_list_code != 'Code11'))
AND prod_grp_date = '2023-10-20'
AND crtd_dttm != '2023-10-20 22:00:00'
AND hashkey != 'hash11';
==================================================================================
table_name : SDL_MDS_SG_STORE_MASTER  
solution : The anomaly in the dataset for table 'SDL_MDS_SG_STORE_MASTER' appears to be related to the 'changetrackingmask', which seems unusually high at '3550'. Review the logic that generates or updates this field, and verify if '3550' is a valid value or if it needs correction. Ensure that the application logic or data input processes are functioning correctly to prevent such anomalies.

SQL query to find anomalies:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_SG_STORE_MASTER
WHERE changetrackingmask > 1000;  -- Adjust the threshold based on your business logic or data expectations
==================================================================================

Based on the provided metadata and sample data for the `MRCHR_RESPONSES` table, here are some identified anomalies and corresponding SQL queries along with recommendations for resolving them:

### Anomaly 1: Negative Values in `FACINGS`, `STOCKCOUNT`, `CATEGORYLENGTH`, and `CATEGORYFACINGS`

#### Anomaly Description:
Negative values are found in columns where they typically should not occur, such as `facings`, `stockcount`, `categorylength`, and `categoryfacings`. These values might represent incorrect data entries or need to be validated if negative values are legitimate in certain contexts.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM MRCHR_RESPONSES
WHERE facings < 0
   OR stockcount < 0
   OR categorylength < 0
   OR categoryfacings < 0;
```

#### Recommendation:
- Investigate the source of these negative values to determine if they represent errors.
- If they are errors, correct the data by replacing negative values with `NULL` or a default positive value, based on business rules.
- Ensure data validation rules are applied at data entry to prevent future occurrences.

### Anomaly 2: Negative or Unusual Values in `PRICEDETAILS`

#### Anomaly Description:
The `pricedetails` column contains a negative value (-4.5) which may indicate a data entry error, as prices are generally non-negative.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM MRCHR_RESPONSES
WHERE pricedetails < 0;
```

#### Recommendation:
- Verify if negative pricing is valid in any specific context or if it represents a discount.
- If invalid, correct these entries by setting them to `NULL` or the correct price, and implement validation checks to prevent similar issues.

### Anomaly 3: Inconsistencies in `OUTOFSTOCK` and `STOCKCOUNT`

#### Anomaly Description:
There are inconsistencies between `outofstock` status and `stockcount` values. For example, `outofstock` is marked as 'Yes' but `stockcount` is not zero or negative.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM MRCHR_RESPONSES
WHERE (outofstock = 'Yes' AND stockcount > 0)
   OR (outofstock = 'No' AND stockcount <= 0);
```

#### Recommendation:
- Review the logic used to determine `outofstock` status. It should be consistent with `stockcount`.
- Update the logic or data to ensure consistency, such as ensuring `outofstock` is 'Yes' only when `stockcount` is zero or negative.

### Anomaly 4: Null or Missing Values in Non-Nullable Columns

#### Anomaly Description:
Check for null or missing values in critical columns that should not contain nulls based on business requirements.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM MRCHR_RESPONSES
WHERE region IS NULL
   OR merchandisingresponseid IS NULL
   OR productid IS NULL;
```

#### Recommendation:
- Determine the business rules for columns that should not contain null values.
- Backfill missing data where possible, and enforce constraints to prevent null entries in critical columns.

### Anomaly 5: Irregular DateTime Entries

#### Anomaly Description:
Check for irregularities in datetime entries, such as future dates that are beyond the current system date or logical inconsistencies.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM MRCHR_RESPONSES
WHERE azuredatetime > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   OR fetcheddatetime > azuredatetime;
```

#### Recommendation:
- Ensure that datetime entries are validated against current dates and logical sequences.
- Correct any erroneous datetime entries and establish checks to mitigate future errors.

Implementing these checks and recommendations will help maintain data integrity and ensure the reliability of the `MRCHR_RESPONSES` table.
==================================================================================
To analyze the data for potential anomalies, we can examine the sample data and schema details for issues like nulls, outliers, and inconsistencies. Below, I have identified potential anomalies and provided SQL queries and recommendations for resolving these issues:

### Anomaly 1: Negative Gross Amount
- **Anomaly Description**: The field `prdgrossamt` contains a negative value (-2000.0), which might indicate an error unless negative amounts are expected (e.g., returns or adjustments).
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
  WHERE PRDGROSSAMT < 0;
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Verify if negative values are valid for this context. If not, check for data entry errors or miscalculations in related fields like `prdqty` or `prdselratebeforetax`.

### Anomaly 2: Suspicious Discount Amounts
- **Anomaly Description**: The `salschdiscamt` has a negative value (-90.0). Discounts should usually be positive amounts.
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
  WHERE SALSCHDISCAMT < 0;
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Review business rules to determine if negative discounts are permissible. If they aren't, correct the data to reflect actual discounts applied.

### Anomaly 3: Null or Missing Values
- **Anomaly Description**: Fields like `dlvboyname`, `salmktretamt`, and others might have missing or null values which could affect downstream processing.
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
  WHERE DLVBOYNAME IS NULL OR SALMKRETAMT IS NULL;
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all necessary fields are populated. For missing data, consider default values or imputation strategies based on historical data.

### Anomaly 4: Inconsistent Data Types
- **Anomaly Description**: `saldlvdate` and `salinvdate` are expected to be timestamps, but ensure they are consistently formatted.
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
  WHERE TRY_CAST(SALDLVDATE AS TIMESTAMP_NTZ) IS NULL
     OR TRY_CAST(SALINVDATE AS TIMESTAMP_NTZ) IS NULL;
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Standardize date formats during data entry or ingestion to maintain consistency and ensure accurate calculations and reporting.

### Anomaly 5: Zero or Negative Quantities
- **Anomaly Description**: Fields like `prdqty` should generally be positive, as they represent quantities sold.
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
  WHERE PRDQTY <= 0;
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Investigate cases where quantities are zero or negative to ensure data accuracy. Adjust values as needed based on source data or business rules.

### Anomaly 6: Mismatched Amounts
- **Anomaly Description**: Check for mismatches between calculated fields like `salnetamt`, which should equal the sum of related fields.
- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM SDL_CSL_DAILYSALES_UNDELIVERED
  WHERE SALNETAMT != (SALGROSSAMT - SALSPLDISCAMT - SALSCHDISCAMT - SALCASHDISCAMT - SALDBDISCAMT + SALTAXAMT + SALWDSAMT + SALOTHERCHARGESAMT + SALROUNDOFFAMT);
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Validate calculations and ensure all related fields contribute accurately to the net amount computation.

These anomalies and recommendations are based on the provided sample data and schema details. Adjustments may be necessary based on a more comprehensive dataset.
==================================================================================
To address your request, we'll identify potential anomalies based on the metadata and sample data provided, generate SQL queries to detect these anomalies, and offer specific recommendations for resolving them. Since the sample data appears to be empty, we'll focus on the metadata to identify potential issues.

### Anomaly 1: Null Values in Important Columns
**Anomaly Description:** Important columns like `ORDERID`, `ORDERDATE`, `CUSTOMER_ID`, and `TOTAL` should not contain null values as they are likely critical for business operations.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ORDERID IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_orderid,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ORDERDATE IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_orderdate,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN CUSTOMER_ID IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_customer_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN TOTAL IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_total
FROM
    SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT;
```

**Recommendation:** 
- Review the data ingestion process to ensure these critical fields are populated.
- Implement NOT NULL constraints on these columns if business rules allow.

### Anomaly 2: Inconsistent Data Types
**Anomaly Description:** Many columns are defined as `TEXT`, which may not be appropriate for numerical fields like `QTY`, `SUBAMT1`, `DISCOUNT`, `TOTALBEFOREVAT`, and `TOTAL`.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE(QTY) IS NULL AND QTY IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS invalid_qty,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE(SUBAMT1) IS NULL AND SUBAMT1 IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS invalid_subamt1,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE(DISCOUNT) IS NULL AND DISCOUNT IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS invalid_discount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE(TOTALBEFOREVAT) IS NULL AND TOTALBEFOREVAT IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS invalid_totalbeforevat,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN TRY_TO_DOUBLE(TOTAL) IS NULL AND TOTAL IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS invalid_total
FROM
    SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT;
```

**Recommendation:** 
- Convert these columns to appropriate numeric data types if they are intended to store numerical data.
- Validate and clean the data to ensure all values can be converted to numbers.

### Anomaly 3: Duplicate Entries
**Anomaly Description:** Duplicate entries in the `ORDERID` column could indicate data integrity issues.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    ORDERID,
    COUNT(*) AS occurrence
FROM
    SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT
GROUP BY
    ORDERID
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Recommendation:** 
- Investigate the source of duplicate entries, which could be due to errors in data ingestion or data entry.
- Implement a unique constraint on the `ORDERID` column if appropriate.

### Anomaly 4: Date Format Consistency
**Anomaly Description:** The `ORDERDATE` column should have consistent date formats to ensure accurate date-related operations.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    ORDERDATE
FROM
    SDL_LA_GT_SALES_ORDER_FACT
WHERE
    TRY_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE, 'YYYY-MM-DD') IS NULL;
```

**Recommendation:** 
- Standardize date formats during data ingestion.
- Consider using the DATE data type for date columns.

These queries and recommendations are based on typical anomalies that can appear in such datasets. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific data characteristics and business requirements.
==================================================================================
Based on the provided metadata and sample data, let's analyze potential anomalies and generate appropriate SQL queries for detection, along with specific recommendations for resolution.

### Anomaly 1: Null Values in `muid` and `distcode_code`
- **Anomaly Description:** `muid` and `distcode_code` columns contain null values, which might indicate missing information or incomplete data.
- **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT id, muid, distcode_code
    FROM SDL_MDS_PH_DISTRIBUTOR_PRODUCT
    WHERE muid IS NULL OR distcode_code IS NULL;
    ```
- **Recommendation:** Investigate the source of data to understand if these fields are optional. If they are required, update the missing values with appropriate data or set default values.

### Anomaly 2: Date Inconsistencies in `promostartperiod` and `promoendperiod`
- **Anomaly Description:** The `promoendperiod` is earlier than the `promostartperiod` for some records, which is illogical for a promotional period.
- **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT id, promostartperiod, promoendperiod
    FROM SDL_MDS_PH_DISTRIBUTOR_PRODUCT
    WHERE promoendperiod < promostartperiod;
    ```
- **Recommendation:** Check the business logic or data entry process that sets these dates. Correct the date entries to ensure that the end period is always after the start period.

### Anomaly 3: Inconsistent `validationstatus`
- **Anomaly Description:** The `validationstatus` is marked as `invalid` for entries with a `versionflag` of `active`, which might be contradictory.
- **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT id, versionflag, validationstatus
    FROM SDL_MDS_PH_DISTRIBUTOR_PRODUCT
    WHERE versionflag = 'active' AND validationstatus = 'invalid';
    ```
- **Recommendation:** Review the validation process to ensure that active versions are correctly validated. If an active version cannot be invalid, update the status or correct underlying issues causing invalidity.

### Anomaly 4: Duplicate Entries
- **Anomaly Description:** Potential duplicate entries based on a combination of `itemcode`, `distcode_code`, and `promoreg_code`.
- **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT itemcode, distcode_code, promoreg_code, COUNT(*)
    FROM SDL_MDS_PH_DISTRIBUTOR_PRODUCT
    GROUP BY itemcode, distcode_code, promoreg_code
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    ```
- **Recommendation:** Determine if duplicates are allowed. If not, identify the root cause of duplication and deduplicate the records by keeping the most recent or relevant entry.

### Anomaly 5: Outdated Entries
- **Anomaly Description:** Entries with `versionflag` as `inactive` and outdated `promoendperiod` might be obsolete.
- **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT id, versionflag, promoendperiod
    FROM SDL_MDS_PH_DISTRIBUTOR_PRODUCT
    WHERE versionflag = 'inactive' AND promoendperiod < CURRENT_DATE;
    ```
- **Recommendation:** Evaluate the need to archive or remove these outdated entries to maintain database efficiency and relevance.

These queries and recommendations should help in identifying and resolving specific anomalies in the dataset, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

==================================================================================
To address the task, we will identify specific anomalies within the provided metadata and sample data, create SQL queries that can detect these anomalies efficiently in Snowflake, and provide recommendations for resolving them.

### Anomalies and Solutions

#### 1. Coordinate Outliers

- **Anomaly Description**: The `latitude` and `longitude` fields contain out-of-range values (e.g., `latitude` = 91.0, which is outside the valid range of -90 to 90, and `longitude` = 181.0, which is outside the valid range of -180 to 180).

- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, latitude, longitude
  FROM SDL_MDS_PH_POS_CUSTOMERS
  WHERE latitude NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90
     OR longitude NOT BETWEEN -180 AND 180;
  ```

- **Recommendation**: Validate coordinate inputs to ensure they fall within the valid geographic range. Correct existing outliers by cross-referencing with reliable geographic data sources.

#### 2. Invalid Time Format

- **Anomaly Description**: The `operating_hrs` field contains an invalid time format (`24:60-25:60`), which doesn't adhere to standard time conventions.

- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, operating_hrs
  FROM SDL_MDS_PH_POS_CUSTOMERS
  WHERE operating_hrs NOT REGEXP '^(0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]-(0[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]$';
  ```

- **Recommendation**: Use a consistent and valid time format (e.g., `HH:MM-HH:MM`). Validate input formats at data entry and update incorrect entries to reflect actual operating hours.

#### 3. Null Values

- **Anomaly Description**: The `address2` field contains null values, which may be acceptable if optional, but should be reviewed for consistency.

- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, address1, address2
  FROM SDL_MDS_PH_POS_CUSTOMERS
  WHERE address2 IS NULL;
  ```

- **Recommendation**: If `address2` is optional, ensure documentation reflects this. If not, attempt to gather missing data or provide a default placeholder.

#### 4. Inconsistent Naming and Codes

- **Anomaly Description**: Multiple fields, such as `class`, `status`, and `region_nm`, contain the word "Inconsistent", indicating placeholders or data entry errors.

- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, class, status, region_nm
  FROM SDL_MDS_PH_POS_CUSTOMERS
  WHERE class LIKE '%Inconsistent%'
     OR status LIKE '%Inconsistent%'
     OR region_nm LIKE '%Inconsistent%';
  ```

- **Recommendation**: Review and correct these fields by verifying data against standardized lists or databases. Implement validation rules to prevent use of placeholder terms.

#### 5. Versioning and Tracking Anomalies

- **Anomaly Description**: There are potential issues with versioning fields such as `enterversionnumber` and `lastchgversionnumber`, which may not represent a logical sequence (e.g., `enterversionnumber` = 100 and `lastchgversionnumber` = 200).

- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, enterversionnumber, lastchgversionnumber
  FROM SDL_MDS_PH_POS_CUSTOMERS
  WHERE enterversionnumber > lastchgversionnumber;
  ```

- **Recommendation**: Ensure version numbers represent a logical progression. Implement checks to maintain version integrity during data entry and updates.

### Summary

These SQL queries aim to efficiently detect anomalies within the `SDL_MDS_PH_POS_CUSTOMERS` table in Snowflake. The recommendations focus on implementing data validation, correcting existing errors, and establishing robust data governance to prevent future inconsistencies.
