Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name: PRODBU_PRODUCTBUSINESSUNIT
solution: The anomaly in this dataset is that the 'DELIVERYUNIT' is set to 'Unit10' which is inconsistent with other entries or expected values. Update 'DELIVERYUNIT' to the correct unit.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM PRODBU_PRODUCTBUSINESSUNIT
WHERE DELIVERYUNIT = 'Unit10';
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: FETCHEDSEQUENCE - The column name suggests a sequence number, typically an integer. However, it is defined as a NUMBER data type, which may include decimals. Ensure that the sequence values are integers or adjust the data type if decimals are necessary.

Issue: FETCHEDDATETIME - The column name implies a datetime format, but it is defined as TEXT in the metadata, which might lead to inconsistencies in data storage and retrieval. Consider changing the data type to a datetime type for better consistency.

Issue: CDL_DATETIME - Similar to FETCHEDDATETIME, this column suggests a datetime format but is stored as TEXT. This could cause inconsistencies. Consider changing the data type to a datetime type.

Issue: AZUREDATETIME - The column name suggests a datetime format, but it is defined as TEXT in the metadata. Recommend changing the data type to a datetime type for consistency and accuracy.

Processing Start Time: 15:04:07
Total Records: 50

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name: SDL_LA_GT_CUSTOMER
solution: The anomaly in the dataset is due to missing or placeholder values in several columns (ARNAME, ARADDRESS, TELEPHONE, FAX, CITY, REGION, SALEDISTRICT, SALEOFFICE, SALEGROUP, ARTYPECODE, SALEEMPLOYEE, SALENAME, BILLNO, BILLMOO, BILLSOI, BILLROAD, BILLSUBDIST, BILLDISTRICT, BILLPROVINCE, BILLZIPCODE, ACTIVESTATUS, ROUTESTEP1, ROUTESTEP2, ROUTESTEP3, ROUTESTEP4, ROUTESTEP5, ROUTESTEP6, ROUTESTEP7, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ROUTESTEP10, STORE, PRICELEVEL, SALESAREANAME, BRANCHCODE, BRANCHNAME, FREQUENCYOFVISIT). These should be reviewed for data completeness and accuracy. Replace 'None' and '-99999' with valid data or handle them appropriately based on business rules.

SQL Query:
SELECT *

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `ARNAME`
- The column contains values like "None" and "Customer Name" which are inconsistent. "None" seems to be a placeholder for missing data and not valid customer names.

Issue: `ARADDRESS`
- The column contains many "None" entries which seem to be placeholders for missing data.

Issue: `TELEPHONE`
- The column contains many "None" entries, which might not be expected for a telephone field.

Issue: `FAX`
- Similar to `TELEPHONE`, the column contains many "None" entries, indicating missing data.

Issue: `BRANCHCODE`, `BRANCHNAME`, `FREQUENCYOFVISIT`, `FILENAME`, `RUN_ID`, `CRT_DTTM`
- These columns contain only "None" values except for `RUN_ID` and `CRT_DTTM`, which suggests incomplete data or placeholder entries for these fields.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name: SDL_KR_COUPANG_BPA_REPORT
solution: 
1. Correct negative value for IMPRESSION_COUNT from -100 to a valid positive number.
2. Ensure CAMPAIGN_END_DATE is after CAMPAIGN_START_DATE. Correct CAMPAIGN_END_DATE to a valid date post 2023-01-01.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_BPA_REPORT
WHERE 
  IMPRESSION_COUNT < 0 
  OR CAMPAIGN_END_DATE < CAMPAIGN_START_DATE;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: CAMPAIGN_START_DATE - The sample data shows a discrepancy in the 4th row where the date is '2023-06-01' instead of the expected '2023-05-01', which does not match the pattern seen in other rows.

Issue: DATA_TYPE in metadata - Despite being labeled as 'TEXT' for most columns, the sample data for columns like DIRECT_AD_RETURN_14D and INDIRECT_AD_RETURN_14D contains numeric values, which may be better suited for a numeric data type rather than text.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name: SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING  
solution: Correct 'VERSIONFLAG' to 'active', set 'ACTIVE' to 1, and update 'VALIDATIONSTATUS' to 'Valid' for ID 24.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING 
WHERE (VERSIONFLAG != 'active' OR ACTIVE != 1 OR VALIDATIONSTATUS != 'Valid') 
  AND ID = 24;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`  
- The column `VERSIONNUMBER` contains a value of `-1` in one of the records, which is inconsistent with its typical representation as a positive integer indicating version sequence.  

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`  
- The column `VALIDATIONSTATUS` contains text values such as "Valid" and "Invalid," which align with its semantic meaning, but ensure that no unexpected values are present as the metadata suggests a maximum length of 500.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
solution : 
1. VERSIONNUMBER should not be negative. Correct VERSIONNUMBER from -32 to a valid positive integer.
2. CHANGETRACKINGMASK should not be negative. Correct CHANGETRACKINGMASK from -245 to a valid positive integer.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
WHERE VERSIONNUMBER < 0 
   OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK < 0;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`
- The column contains negative numbers, which may not be semantically appropriate for a version number. Typically, version numbers are non-negative and increment sequentially.

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`
- In the sample data, the values are either "valid" or "invalid". The metadata suggests a maximum length of 500, which seems excessive for the observed values. Consider restricting the length or ensuring the values are more descriptive if needed.

Issue: `ID`
- The column contains negative numbers, which may not be appropriate if `ID` is meant to be a unique identifier. Typically, IDs are positive integers.

solution : 
1. ID should be a positive integer, but found -1.
2. VERSIONNUMBER should be positive, but found 0.
3. VERSION_ID should be a positive integer, but found -5.
4. CHANGETRACKINGMASK has an invalid negative value: -999.
5. ENTERVERSIONNUMBER should be positive, but found -10.
6. VALIDATIONSTATUS should not be 'Invalid'; it indicates a validation failure.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *

WHERE ID < 0
   OR VERSIONNUMBER <= 0
   OR VERSION_ID < 0
   OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK < 0
   OR ENTERVERSIONNUMBER <= 0
   OR VALIDATIONSTATUS = 'Invalid';
Semantic Analysis:
1. **ID**
   - **Issue:** The column name "ID" suggests it should contain unique identifiers, but there is a duplicate value of "1" in the records.

2. **VERSIONNUMBER**
   - **Issue:** The column name "VERSIONNUMBER" suggests a sequential or logical numbering system, but there is an irregular jump from "4" to "99999".

Other columns appear to align with their semantic meanings and the data they hold.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `CDL_DATETIME`  
- The data type in metadata is `TEXT`, but the data appears to be a `DATETIME` format. 

Issue: `FETCHEDDATETIME`  
- The data type in metadata is `TEXT`, but the data appears to be a `DATETIME` format. 

Issue: `AZUREDATETIME`  
- The data type in metadata is `TEXT`, but the data appears to be a `DATETIME` format. 

Issue: `FETCHEDSEQUENCE`  
- The data type in metadata is `NUMBER`, and the data appears to be numeric, which aligns. However, the data contains negative values, which might not be semantically expected unless negative sequences are valid in the domain context.

Issue: `LOAD_KEY`  
- The data type in metadata is `TEXT`, but the data appears to be an identifier format, which may or may not be valid, depending on the context. Ensure if it should be a numeric or specific format identifier.

   OR CATEGORYFACINGS < 0;
Semantic Analysis:
Based on the provided data and metadata, here are the columns with potential issues:

1. **FETCHEDSEQUENCE**:
   - Issue: Although the data type is listed as NUMBER, which typically suggests a numerical value, there are negative values present in the sample data. Depending on the context, negative values might not make sense for a sequence and could indicate an error.

2. **FETCHEDDATETIME**:
   - Issue: The data type is listed as TEXT, but this column contains date-time values. It is generally more appropriate for date-time values to be stored in a DATE or DATETIME format rather than TEXT for better functionality and operations.

3. **CDL_DATETIME**:
   - Issue: Similar to FETCHEDDATETIME, this column contains date-time values but is also listed as TEXT in the metadata. Using a DATE or DATETIME format would be more suitable.

Please review these columns for potential data type corrections or validation of data integrity.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `MUID`
- The column `MUID` appears to hold a mix of UUIDs and `None` values, which may be unexpected if all entries are expected to have unique identifiers. A UUID is typically a 36-character string, and the presence of `None` might indicate missing data which may not be intended.

Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`
- The `VERSIONNUMBER` column includes a `-1` value, which is unconventional for a version number as they typically start from `0` or `1`. This might indicate an error or a placeholder that needs further investigation.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_PS_TARGETS
WHERE VALUE < 0;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `ID`
- The value `-1` in the first row suggests that negative IDs might be used for special cases, which may not align with typical expectations of non-negative identifiers.

Issue: `VERSION_ID`
- The value `-5` in the fifth row is negative, which is unexpected for an identifier typically assumed to be non-negative.

Issue: `LASTCHGUSERNAME`
- The value `None` in the fourth row indicates missing data, which might be an error if all changes are expected to have an associated username.

Issue: `VERSIONNAME`
- The value `None` in the fourth row indicates missing data, which might be an error if all versions are expected to have a name.

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`
- The presence of both "Valid" and "Invalid" statuses is expected, but verify that all entries correctly reflect the true validation status.

WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(FILENAME, '[^a-zA-Z0-9_.-]') OR REGEXP_LIKE(PATH, '(^\/$|^$|[^a-zA-Z0-9\/_.-])');
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: TASKID
- The data type is TEXT, but TASKID typically represents a numeric or alphanumeric identifier. It's expected to be more structured, like an integer or a specific pattern, rather than generic text.

Issue: FILENAME
- The column holds values prefixed with "invalid_file_name_", which suggests potential placeholder or incorrect file naming. The semantic meaning implies valid file names should be stored here.

Issue: PATH
- The PATH column contains "/invalid/path/to/file", indicating a placeholder or incorrect path. It should typically contain valid directory paths to the files.

Issue: BRAND
- While the data type and format are generally correct, the presence of 'None' for some records might suggest missing or unassigned brand information that needs addressing.

Issue: SALESPERSON_FIRSTNAME and SALESPERSON_LASTNAME
- Both columns contain 'None' for some records, indicating missing salesperson data, which may need to be validated or completed.

Issue: SECONDARYTRADECODE
- The values look like codes, but the text type and potential variability in length suggest a need to confirm that these are standardized codes used consistently across the dataset.

Issue: SECONDARYTRADENAME
- Similar to BRAND and SALESPERSON columns, the presence of 'None' suggests incomplete trade name information, which might need validation or completion.

SELECT *
FROM SDL_LA_GT_ROUTE_DETAIL_TEMP
WHERE CREATED_DATE > FILE_UPLOAD_DATE;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `CREATED_DATE`
- Although the column is named `CREATED_DATE`, the associated metadata indicates its `DATA_TYPE` is `TEXT`. Typically, a column with a name suggesting a date would have a `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` data type. This could potentially lead to issues if date-specific operations are performed without conversion.

Issue: `FILE_UPLOAD_DATE`
- The metadata indicates `DATA_TYPE` as `DATE`, which is correct, but there are entries like `2023-11-01` that appear to be in a `DATE` format but are recorded as `TEXT` in the dataset. This discrepancy might lead to confusion in data handling or analysis operations.

Ensure both these columns have consistent data types in the dataset and metadata to prevent potential issues in data processing.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_MDS_SG_PRODUCT_MAPPING
solution : Ensure consistency in ID and MUID fields to maintain data integrity. Check if the CUSTOMER_NAME_CODE and CUSTOMER_NAME_ID align correctly with corresponding names. Validate that the CUSTOMER_BRAND_CODE and CUSTOMER_BRAND_ID accurately map to their brand names. Confirm that the VERSIONNUMBER and VERSION_ID are consistent across entries.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_MDS_SG_PRODUCT_MAPPING
WHERE (ID IS NULL OR MUID IS NULL OR VERSIONNAME IS NULL OR VERSIONNUMBER IS NULL OR VERSION_ID IS NULL OR VERSIONFLAG IS NULL OR NAME IS NULL OR CODE IS NULL OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_NAME_CODE IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_NAME_NAME IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_NAME_ID IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_BRAND_CODE IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_BRAND_NAME IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_BRAND_ID IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_PRODUCT_CODE IS NULL OR CUSTOMER_PRODUCT_NAME IS NULL OR material IS NULL OR code IS NULL OR master IS NULL OR code IS NULL OR product IS NULL OR name IS NULL OR ENTERDATETIME IS NULL OR ENTERUSERNAME IS NULL OR ENTERVERSIONNUMBER IS NULL OR LASTCHGDATETIME IS NULL OR LASTCHGUSERNAME IS NULL OR LASTCHGVERSIONNUMBER IS NULL OR VALIDATIONSTATUS IS NULL)

Semantic Analysis:
Based on the provided sample data and metadata, here are the columns with potential issues:

1. **VERSIONNUMBER**:
   - Issue: The column contains negative values (e.g., -1, -4, -9), which might not align with the expected semantic meaning of a version number typically being non-negative.

2. **VERSIONNAME**:
   - Issue: The column name suggests a textual description of a version, but since no specific issue is present in the sample data, ensure that all version names are consistent and meaningful.

3. **VALIDATIONSTATUS**:
   - Issue: The column name suggests a status indicator, but the sample data shows values like "valid_1", which may not clearly convey a typical status (e.g., "valid", "invalid"). Ensure the values align with expected validation statuses.

If further data inspection is needed, ensure these columns maintain consistency and semantic alignment across the dataset.

Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTE_AUDITS
solution : AUDIT_FORM_ID is None, expected a valid ID.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTE_AUDITS
WHERE AUDIT_FORM_ID IS NULL;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: VISIT_ID
- Some rows have 'None' instead of a text identifier which might indicate missing or incorrect data.

Issue: AUDIT_FORM_ID
- Some rows have 'None' instead of a text identifier which might suggest missing or incorrect data.

Issue: SECTION
- Some rows have 'None', which may indicate missing section names.

Issue: RUN_ID
- Contains negative numbers, which may not align with typical expectations for a run identifier.
