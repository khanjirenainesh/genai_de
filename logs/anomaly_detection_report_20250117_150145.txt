Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `ORDER_ID`
- The sample data shows a repeated value for `ORDER_ID` ("ORD123") with different times for `ORDER_COMPLETED_TIME`, which may indicate an error if `ORDER_ID` is expected to be a unique identifier for each order.

Issue: `ORDER_COMPLETED_TIME`
- In one instance, `ORDER_COMPLETED_TIME` ("2023-07-14 10:00:00") is before `ORDER_TIME` ("2023-07-15 09:00:00"), which is logically inconsistent as an order cannot be completed before it is placed.

Semantic Analysis:
Column: ID
Issue: Although the 'ID' column is expected to contain unique identifiers (possibly integers), it is defined as a 'TEXT' data type, which might not be suitable if numeric operations are intended. 

Column: CDATE
Issue: 'CDATE' represents dates (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD') but is stored as 'TEXT'. Using a date data type would be more appropriate for date-specific operations.

Column: RUN_ID
Issue: 'RUN_ID' is stored as a 'NUMBER' but the sample data contains negative values, which might not logically align with its purpose as an identifier. Further validation might be needed to ensure the values align with expected use.

Column: YEARMO
Issue: 'YEARMO' represents a combination of year and month in a 'YYYYMM' format but is defined as 'TEXT'. A numeric data type might be more appropriate for chronological operations.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `CHECK_OUT_DATETIME` - The sample data contains a date in 2022 for one record, which seems inconsistent with the other records from 2023. This might indicate a data entry error.

Issue: `CANCELLED_VISIT` - The sample data contains unexpected negative and large positive values (e.g., -99999, 99999, 100000), which may indicate data entry errors or misuse of the column meant to represent cancellation status. Typically, this should represent a binary state (e.g., 0 for not canceled, 1 for canceled).

Issue: `CHECK_OUT_DATETIME` - In record 3, the check-in and check-out times are identical (11:00:00), which might be unusual for a visit and potentially indicates a data inconsistency.

Issue: `POPDB_ID` and `POP_CODE` - In record 3, both fields have 'None,' which may suggest missing or incomplete data for this visit.

1. DISTCODE cannot be None, should be a valid district code. Issue in row with SMID=50.
2. SMID cannot be negative. Issue in row with SMID=-1.
3. SMDAILYALLOWANCE cannot be negative. Issue in row with SMID=-1.
4. SMCREDITDAYS cannot be negative. Issue in row with SMID=15.

6. SMMKTCREDIT is unusually high compared to SMMONTHLYSALARY. Verify value in row with SMID=50.
7. SMCREDITDAYS is unusually high. Verify value in row with SMID=50.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_CSL_SALESMANMASTER
WHERE DISTCODE IS NULL
   OR SMID < 0
   OR SMDAILYALLOWANCE < 0
   OR SMCREDITDAYS < 0
   OR SMDAILYALLOWANCE > 2000  -- Assuming 2000 is a threshold for unusually high allowance
   OR SMMKTCREDIT > SMMONTHLYSALARY
   OR SMCREDITDAYS > 365; -- Assuming 365 days is a practical limit
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `DISTCODE` - The column name suggests it should contain a district code, but it has entries with 'None', indicating missing values. If `DISTCODE` is meant to be non-null, this is an issue.

Issue: `SMCODE` - The column contains 'None' in some rows, which may indicate missing salesperson codes. If `SMCODE` is intended to be unique and always present, this is an issue.

Issue: `SMNAME` - The column has 'None' in some rows, suggesting missing salesperson names. If every salesperson should have a name, this is an issue.

Issue: `SMPHONENO` - The column has 'None' in some rows, indicating missing phone numbers. If every salesperson is expected to have a phone number, this is an issue.

Issue: `SMEMAIL` - The column contains 'None' in some rows, suggesting missing email addresses. If every salesperson should have an email, this is an issue.

Issue: `FILE_NAME` - The column name suggests a file naming convention, but it has entries with 'None', indicating missing file names. If `FILE_NAME` is expected to be present for every entry, this is an issue.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_MDS_MY_GT_PRODUCT_MAPPING
solution : 
- Row ID 44: Correct `ENTERVERSIONNUMBER` as it is NaN, should match `VERSIONNUMBER` = 45.0.
- Row ID 45: Correct `VERSIONNAME` as `VERSIONNUMBER` is NaN, should be 46.0.
- Row ID 49: Correct `CHANGETRACKINGMASK` as it is NaN, should be a valid numeric value.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: VERSIONNUMBER  
- The column contains negative numbers and NaN values, which may not align with the expected semantic meaning of a version number being a positive number.

Issue: VERSION_ID  
- This column has negative numbers, which could be misleading if version IDs are expected to be positive.

Issue: NON_SAP  
- The column contains "Yes" and "No" values, which may not clearly align with the semantic meaning of "NON_SAP". A clearer description or binary indicator might be expected.

The rest of the columns appear to have data that aligns with their column names based on the provided sample data.

Semantic Analysis:
1. COLUMN_NAME: POP_LIST_DATE
   Issue: Although the column name suggests it should contain dates, the metadata lists it as nullable, and the sample data supports that it contains a date format. Ensure the column consistently holds valid date values and that any null values are intended and properly handled.

2. COLUMN_NAME: STATUS
   Issue: The name "STATUS" might imply a categorical or binary status, but the data contains a range of numbers, including negative values. Clarification on what these numerical values represent is necessary to determine if they align with the intended meaning of "status."

3. COLUMN_NAME: RUN_ID
   Issue: The column name "RUN_ID" suggests a positive identifier or sequence number, but the sample data contains negative values. Verify if negative values are valid for this field.

4. COLUMN_NAME: HASHKEY
   Issue: The column name "HASHKEY" implies a unique hash, potentially for integrity or security purposes, but without additional context, it's challenging to determine if the provided strings are valid hash values. Ensure they are unique and meet any necessary hashing standards.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: SELLER_USERNAME  
- The data in the second row is `None`, which is not consistent with a username. Ideally, this should be a valid username if the seller is known.

Issue: ORDER_VALUE  
- The data in the second row is `-200.0000`, which is unusual for an order value as it suggests a negative transaction, which might not align with typical order value expectations unless specifically representing a refund or similar transaction.

Issue: IS_NEW_BUYER_PRICE  
- The data in the fourth row is `-1`, which might be unexpected since this column typically represents a binary indicator (0 or 1) indicating whether the price is for a new buyer.

Issue: BUNDLE_ORD_ITMID  
- The data in the third row is `None`, which might be unexpected if every order is supposed to have a bundle order item ID. 

Issue: ESCROW_PAID_DATE  
- The format is `TEXT`, but typically dates should be in a more structured date format for better validation and processing. 

Note: These issues are based on assumptions about typical use cases and expected constraints in such datasets.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: RANKING
- The RANKING column is expected to hold numerical data representing the rank of a product. However, it is defined as TEXT in the metadata. This misalignment could lead to sorting and comparison issues when processing the data.

Issue: RUN_ID
- RUN_ID contains negative numbers, which may not be expected if this is intended to be a strictly positive identifier or sequence number. The presence of negative values suggests potential data quality issues or incorrect data entry.

Issue: JNJ_PRODUCT_FLAG
- The JNJ_PRODUCT_FLAG column contains both 'Y' and 'N', which is semantically valid. However, the metadata lists its data type as TEXT, which is appropriate. Ensure consistent use of 'Y'/'N' as flags without additional unexpected characters.

Note: These are the identified issues based on the data provided. Ensure data integrity and consistency for accurate analysis and processing.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_ECOMMERCE_OFFTAKE_AMAZON
solution : 
1. QUANTITY should not be negative. Correct the QUANTITY for RPC 12345678901234567890 with LOAD_DATE 2023-01-01 12:00:00.
2. MRP should not be negative. Correct the MRP for RPC 12345678901234567891 with LOAD_DATE 2023-01-02 12:00:00.
3. MRP_OFFTAKES_VALUE should not be negative. Correct the MRP_OFFTAKES_VALUE for RPC 12345678901234567890 with LOAD_DATE 2023-02-10 12:00:00.
 
SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_ECOMMERCE_OFFTAKE_AMAZON
WHERE QUANTITY < 0 OR MRP < 0 OR MRP_OFFTAKES_VALUE < 0;
Semantic Analysis:
1. **QUANTITY**:
   - Issue: The column contains negative values (e.g., -10, -5). Typically, "QUANTITY" should represent a non-negative integer, indicating the number of items sold or available.

2. **MRP**:
   - Issue: The column contains negative values (e.g., -1000.0, -250.0). "MRP" (Maximum Retail Price) is expected to be a non-negative float, representing the price at which a product is sold to consumers.

3. **MRP_OFFTAKES_VALUE**:
   - Issue: The column contains negative values (e.g., -16000.0, -1440.0). While it might be contextually valid to have negative values to indicate returns or adjustments, typically, "OFFTAKES_VALUE" would be expected to be non-negative, or it should be clearly documented that negative values are possible for specific reasons.

Total Records: 50

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
solution : 
1. ID value '-40' and '-44' are invalid as ID should be a positive integer or UUID. Correct to valid UUIDs.
2. VERSIONNAME 'None' for ID '3' should be updated to a valid name.
3. VERSIONNUMBER '-50', '-28', and '30' seem to be inconsistent or negative; ensure all are positive and consistent.
4. NAME 'None' for ID '3' should be updated to a valid name.
5. CODE 'None' for ID '3' should be updated to a valid code.
6. CHANGETRACKINGMASK '-215' and '-235' should be positive integers.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
WHERE ID <= 0 OR VERSIONNAME = 'None' OR VERSIONNUMBER < 0 OR NAME = 'None' OR CODE = 'None' OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK < 0;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`
- The column name suggests it should contain positive version numbers. However, there are negative values present, which may not align with typical version numbering conventions.

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`
- The metadata indicates a maximum character length of 500. However, the data only shows "valid" or "invalid". This discrepancy in expected length could indicate a potential mismatch or misunderstanding in data requirements.

Issue: `ID`
- The column name suggests a unique identifier, which usually consists of positive integers. However, there are negative values present, which might not align with typical ID conventions.

Issue: `MUID`
- The metadata specifies a maximum character length of 36, which matches the format of a UUID. However, the data uses a UUID format, so while the length matches, the semantic meaning of "MUID" is unclear if it should specifically reference a UUID.

2. Anomalous row 2: FETCHEDSEQUENCE should not be negative. Update FETCHEDSEQUENCE from -8 to a valid positive value.
3. Anomalous row 3: COUNTRY should be USA instead of WAK. Update COUNTRY from WAK to USA.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM CUST_CUSTOMER
WHERE FETCHEDSEQUENCE < 0
   OR COUNTRY NOT IN ('USA');
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: REGION  
- The column 'REGION' contains the value 'None', which is not a valid region name.  

Issue: FETCHEDSEQUENCE  
- The column 'FETCHEDSEQUENCE' contains negative numbers, which may not semantically align with a sequence number expected to be non-negative.  

Issue: CDL_DATETIME  
- The metadata indicates 'CDL_DATETIME' is of type TEXT with a maximum length of 24. It holds datetime values, which suggests a more appropriate data type could be a datetime format rather than text.  

Issue: AZUREDATETIME  
- The metadata indicates 'AZUREDATETIME' is of type TEXT with a maximum length of 32. It holds datetime values, which suggests a more appropriate data type could be a datetime format rather than text.  

Issue: FETCHEDDATETIME  
- The metadata indicates 'FETCHEDDATETIME' is of type TEXT with a maximum length of 32. It holds datetime values, which suggests a more appropriate data type could be a datetime format rather than text.

   OR RTNFREEQTYVALUE < 0 
   OR RTRID < 0;
Semantic Analysis:
1. Column Name: SRNGROSSAMT
   Issue: The column name suggests it should contain gross amounts, likely positive values representing total sales before deductions. However, the sample data contains negative values, which might indicate returns or refunds. Check if the data aligns with the expected use of this column.

2. Column Name: NRVALUE
   Issue: This column name might suggest a "net return value" or similar metric. The sample data shows negative values, which could be valid for returns but should be confirmed if these are expected or indicative of another issue.

3. Column Name: PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX
   Issue: The column name suggests it should contain selling rates after tax, typically expected to be positive. The sample data shows negative values, which could be incorrect unless indicating a refund or return scenario.

4. Column Name: RUN_ID
   Issue: The column name suggests a unique identifier for each run or transaction. The sample data contains negative values, which is unusual for an ID field. This might indicate an error unless negative values are used for a specific purpose.

5. Column Name: FILE_NAME
   Issue: The sample data contains file names like "file001", "file002", etc. While these are valid file names, ensure they match the expected naming conventions or if they carry any specific information (e.g., date, batch number) that should be validated.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:

solution : 
1. SALNETAMT should equal SALGROSSAMT - SALTOTDEDN + SALTOTADDN + SALROUNDOFFAMT. Verify calculations: 40000 - 5800 + 0 + 0 = 34200 is correct.
2. PRDNETAMT should equal PRDGROSSAMT - PRDSPLDISCAMT - PRDSCHDISCAMT - PRDCASHDISCAMT - PRDDBDISCAMT + PRDTAXAMT. Verify calculations: 40000 - 2000 - 1000 - 400 - 200 + 1600 = 34200 is correct.

SQL Query:
SELECT *

   OR (PRDNETAMT != (PRDGROSSAMT - PRDSPLDISCAMT - PRDSCHDISCAMT - PRDCASHDISCAMT - PRDDBDISCAMT + PRDTAXAMT));
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `DISTCODE`
- The value `None` in row 3 does not align with its expected format as a district code, which is typically a non-null alphanumeric identifier.

Issue: `NRVALUE`
- All values are `0.000000`, which may indicate an issue if `NRVALUE` is expected to represent non-zero numerical data.

Issue: `VCPSCHEMEAMOUNT`
- All values are `0.000000`, which may indicate an issue if `VCPSCHEMEAMOUNT` is expected to represent non-zero numerical data.

(Note: The analysis assumes that `NRVALUE` and `VCPSCHEMEAMOUNT` should contain meaningful non-zero data based on typical use cases. If these columns are allowed to have zero values under certain conditions, then there may not be an issue.)

Semantic Analysis:
Column: ABC
Issue: Data "Duplicate Entry", "None", etc., suggests text labels rather than standard identifiers or codes expected with a column name like "ABC".

Column: apo-copy_history
Issue: Data "Incorrect", "HistoryB", etc., suggests this might be a text or status description rather than a traditional copy history which might expect dates or identifiers.

Column: apo-dp_product_type
Issue: Data "TypeA", "TypeB", etc., suggests text labels which may align, but further context is needed to confirm if these are valid types.

Column: apo-forecast_ind
Issue: Data "1", "2", "3", etc., suggests numeric indicators which could be valid; however, without context, it's unclear if these are appropriate forecast indicators.

Column: apo-master_code
Issue: Data "MC001", "MC002", etc., suggests these are codes but should be confirmed if they accurately represent master codes without duplicates or errors.

Column: VERSION_ID
Issue: Data "1", "2", "3", etc., appears to align with version identifiers, but should be checked for correctness and uniqueness.

Column: VERSIONFLAG
Issue: Data "A", "B", "C", etc., suggests flag identifiers but should be verified for appropriate context use.

Column: VERSIONNAME
Issue: Data "VersionA", "VersionB", etc., suggests version names which may align, but should be validated for correctness and consistency.

Column: VERSIONNUMBER
Issue: Data "1", "2", "3", etc., aligns with version numbering but should be confirmed for proper sequential and logical order.
