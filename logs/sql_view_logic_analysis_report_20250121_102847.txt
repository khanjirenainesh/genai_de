- **Hardcoded Values Analysis**:
  - Hardcoded 'Y' in `ECOMMERCEFLAG` and `MARKETINGPERMISSION`.
    - Risks: Changes in logic need code updates.
    - Suggestion: Use parameters for flags.
    - Sample Code:
      ```sql
      WHEN ECOMMERCEFLAG = :ecommerce_flag THEN 'Yes'
      ```
  - Date format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'.
    - Risks: Locale changes require code changes.
    - Suggestion: Use configuration for date formats.
    - Sample Code:
      ```sql
      TO_DATE(FETCHEDDATETIME, :date_format)
      ```

- **Query Structure Optimization**:
  - No nested queries or subqueries to optimize.
  - Select statement includes specific columns.
  - No `SELECT *` used.
  - All columns are utilized in the output or conditions.

- **Join Analysis**:
  - No joins present to analyze.

- **Performance Enhancement Recommendations**:
  - **Coding Standards**:
    - Table aliases not needed as only one table is used.
    - Proper formatting and indentation already present.
    - No indexes or temporary tables/CTEs needed.
    - No materialized view opportunity identified.
  - **Performance**:
    - No partitioning or clustering keys applicable.
    - Snowflake query result caching is automatic.
    - Execution plan optimization not needed.

- **Priority Ranking**:
  - Parameterization of flags and date formats: Medium

- **Risks or Dependencies**:
  - Parameterization requires application-level support for dynamic values.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW CustomerOverviewOptimized AS
SELECT 
    REGION,
    CUSTOMERID,
    CUSTOMERNAME,
    COUNTRY,
    COUNTY,
    DISTRICT,

    -- Optimized formatting of FETCHEDDATETIME
    TO_CHAR(FETCHEDDATETIME, 'DD-Mon-YYYY HH24:MI') AS FETCHEDDATETIME_FORMATTED,

    -- Counting fetched sequences once
    COUNT(FETCHEDSEQUENCE) AS TOTAL_FETCHES,

    -- Simplified CASE statement
    CASE 
        WHEN ECOMMERCEFLAG = 'Y' THEN 'Enabled'
        ELSE 'Disabled'
    END AS ECOMMERCE_STATUS,

    -- Simplified marketing permission logic
    CASE 
        WHEN MARKETINGPERMISSION = 'Y' THEN 'Granted'
        ELSE 'Denied'
    END AS MARKETING_PERMISSION_STATUS,

    -- Efficiently combining street name and number
    STREETNAME || ' ' || STREETNUMBER AS FULL_ADDRESS,

    -- Handling potential NULLs when extracting year
    CASE WHEN CDL_DATETIME IS NOT NULL THEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CDL_DATETIME) END AS CDL_YEAR

FROM 
    CUST_CUSTOMER

-- Simplified WHERE clause
WHERE 
    COUNTRY IS NOT NULL
AND 
    ECOMMERCEFLAG = 'Y'
AND 
    MARKETINGPERMISSION IN ('Y', 'N')

-- Grouping by necessary columns only
GROUP BY 
    REGION, CUSTOMERID, CUSTOMERNAME, COUNTRY, COUNTY, DISTRICT, CITY, POSTCODE, 
    STREETNAME, STREETNUMBER, EMAIL, PHONENUMBER, STORETYPE, WEBSITE;
```

### Analysis:

#### Hardcoded Values:
1. `ECOMMERCEFLAG = 'Y'`, `MARKETINGPERMISSION = 'Y'`, `MARKETINGPERMISSION = 'N'`
   - **Risks**: Limits flexibility; Changes require code updates.
   - **Alternative**: Use parameterized queries or config tables.
   - **Sample Code**:
     ```sql
     WHERE ECOMMERCEFLAG = :ecommerce_flag
     AND MARKETINGPERMISSION IN (:marketing_permission_granted, :marketing_permission_denied)
     ```

#### Query Structure Optimization:
- **Flattening Opportunities**: No nested queries exist to flatten.
- **Unused Columns**: `FETCHEDDATETIME`, `CDL_DATETIME` removed from GROUP BY.
- **Select Specific Columns**: Removed `SELECT *`.

#### Join Analysis:
- **No joins present**: No actions required.

#### Performance Enhancement Recommendations:
- **Column Formatting**: Used direct concatenation for `FULL_ADDRESS`.
- **Indexing**: Consider indexing `COUNTRY`, `ECOMMERCEFLAG`, `MARKETINGPERMISSION` for WHERE optimization.
- **CTE vs Temp Table**: No CTE/temp tables used.

#### Performance Recommendations:
- **Caching**: Enable result caching if not already.
- **Execution Plan**: Analyze plan for further tuning opportunities.

#### Priority Ranking:
- **Parameterization**: High
- **Indexing**: Medium
- **Remove Redundancies**: Medium
- **Execution Plan Tuning**: Low

#### Risks/Dependencies:
- Ensure parameter values are correctly passed for dynamic queries.
- Index creation requires additional storage and maintenance.

```plaintext
Syntax Errors:
- None

Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names:
- None

Commas, FROM/WHERE Clause, Proper Join and Case Statements in Nested Subqueries:
- None
```
### Hardcoded Values Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Values:**
   - The query does not contain any explicit hardcoded values. 

### Query Structure Optimization

1. **Nested Queries and Subqueries:**
   - The given query does not contain any nested queries or subqueries as it is a direct select operation from a table.

2. **Column Usage:**
   - **SELECT * Statement:**
     - Present in `SELECT * FROM DAILYSALES;`
     - **Suggestion:** Avoid using `SELECT *` to improve performance and retrieve only necessary columns.
     - **Optimized SELECT Statement:** 
       ```sql
       CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dailysales_view AS 
       SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN FROM DAILYSALES;
       ```
     - **Priority:** High
     - **Unused Columns:** As it's not clear which columns are needed, you must specify columns based on actual requirements.

### Join Analysis

1. **JOIN Operations:**
   - There are no JOIN operations in the provided query.

### Performance Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Coding Standards Improvements:**
   - **Table Aliases and Naming Conventions:**
     - Use meaningful aliases if needed in complex queries. Not applicable here.
   - **Proper Indentation and Formatting:**
     - The query is simple; formatting is adequate.
   - **Indexes:**
     - Ensure the `DAILYSALES` table has appropriate indexes, especially if large.
   - **Temporary Table vs CTE Usage:**
     - Not applicable as the query is straightforward.
   - **Materialized View Opportunities:**
     - Consider a materialized view if the `DAILYSALES` data is static or changes infrequently.
     - **Priority:** Medium

2. **Performance-Focused Recommendations:**
   - **Partitioning Strategies:**
     - If `DAILYSALES` is large, consider partitioning by a date or sales-specific column.
     - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Clustering Keys:**
     - Introduce clustering keys if frequent query filters on specific columns.
     - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Query Result Caching:**
     - Ensure result caching is enabled for frequent access.
     - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Execution Plan Optimization:**
     - Regularly review execution plans for performance insights.
     - **Priority:** Low

**Before Code Example:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dailysales_view AS 
SELECT * FROM DAILYSALES;
```

**After Code Example:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dailysales_view AS 
SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN FROM DAILYSALES;
```

**Expected Performance Impact:**
- Reduced data retrieval overhead.
- Improved query execution time by fetching only necessary columns.

**Potential Risks or Dependencies:**
- Ensure all required columns are specified in the revised query to avoid missing data in the view.
