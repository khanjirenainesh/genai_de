Anomaly Analysis:
### Anomaly Analysis and Solutions

**table_name**: Anomalous Rows

**solution**: The dataset has anomalies such as negative values where they are not expected. Specifically:
- `SALNETAMT`: Negative net amount indicates a possible data entry error or return transaction. Verify if this is accurately captured, or correct if erroneous.
- `PRDQTY`: Negative quantity is invalid for sales data. Check for data entry mistakes or misinterpretations and correct them.
- `PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX`, `PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX`: Ensure sales rates are positive, reflecting actual pricing.
- `PRDNETAMT`: Negative net amount suggests either discounts exceeding sales or incorrect data entry. Validate and rectify accordingly.

### Sensitive Data and Compliance

**column_name**: SALESMANNAME, SALESROUTENAME, DLVBOYNAME, FILE_NAME

**solution**: These columns may contain sensitive personal information. Consider compliance with PII, GDPR, and SOC2 standards.

- **SALESMANNAME, SALESROUTENAME, DLVBOYNAME**: Use data masking techniques such as partial masking (e.g., showing only first and last characters) or tokenization for privacy protection.
- **FILE_NAME**: Mask file names if they contain personal data using hashing to ensure pseudonymization.

### Snowflake-Specific SQL Query

```sql
-- Detect anomalies in the dataset
SELECT
    *,
    CASE
        WHEN SALNETAMT < 0 THEN 'Negative SALNETAMT'
        WHEN PRDQTY < 0 THEN 'Negative PRDQTY'
        WHEN PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX < 0 THEN 'Negative PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX'
        WHEN PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX < 0 THEN 'Negative PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX'
        WHEN PRDNETAMT < 0 THEN 'Negative PRDNETAMT'
        ELSE 'No Issue'
    END AS anomaly_issue
FROM
    your_table_name
WHERE
    SALNETAMT < 0
    OR PRDQTY < 0
    OR PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX < 0
    OR PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX < 0
    OR PRDNETAMT < 0;
```

### Explanation

- This query selects all columns from `your_table_name` and adds a new column `anomaly_issue` to categorize the type of anomaly detected based on negative values in financial and quantity-related fields.
- The WHERE clause filters out all rows with any negative values in the specified columns, which are likely errors in the dataset.
- The use of a CASE statement helps identify the specific column that contains the anomaly, aiding in targeted data correction efforts.

Ensure to replace `your_table_name` with the actual table name in your Snowflake database.
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: MODIFIEDDATE - The sample data contains a timestamp in the format "2023-10-01 11:00:00", which aligns with the TIMESTAMP_NTZ data type. Ensure the correct timezone handling if necessary.

Issue: SALESMANCODE - The sample data shows a value "SM001", fitting within the TEXT data type with a CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH of 100. No issues with the semantic meaning, but verify if VARCHAR would be more optimal for smaller strings.

Issue: LCNID - The sample data shows a value "1", which aligns with the NUMBER data type. Ensure it handles potential null values as indicated by IS_NULLABLE being "YES".

```

This output highlights potential optimization or verification points rather than semantic misalignments since the sample data generally seems to match its column definitions. Adjustments are made based on Snowflake-specific considerations such as data type suitability and potential null handling.

### Compliance and Masking Suggestions

#### column name : EMP_ADDRESS_PC
solution : This column may contain PII data. Consider masking or encrypting it to comply with GDPR and SOC2 standards.

#### column name : SUPERVISOR_NAME
solution : As it might contain PII, consider using a redaction technique or tokenization to comply with GDPR and SOC2 standards.

#### column name : ACCOUNT
solution : This column should be masked or encrypted using a format-preserving encryption technique to comply with PCI-DSS and GDPR.

#### column name : STORE_ID
solution : Use hashing or tokenization as a masking technique to anonymize the data for SOC2 compliance.

### Masking Techniques
- **Redaction**: For names and other text fields.
- **Tokenization**: For IDs and account numbers.
- **Hashing**: For unique identifiers that do not require reversibility.
- **Format-Preserving Encryption**: For maintaining the format in encrypted fields, like credit card numbers.
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
COLUMN_NAME: COP_DATE
Issue: The data type is TEXT, but the column contains date information. Consider using DATE data type for optimized storage and querying.

COLUMN_NAME: EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR
Issue: While the column name suggests it should contain addresses, the sample data shows numeric values. Verify if the data type and content are appropriate.

COLUMN_NAME: SUPERVISOR_NAME
Issue: The column name suggests it should contain names, but the sample data shows numeric values. Verify if the data type and content are appropriate.

COLUMN_NAME: YEARMO
Issue: The data type is TEXT, but the column contains year-month information. Consider using a more appropriate data type like DATE or VARCHAR with a specific format.

COLUMN_NAME: RUN_ID
Issue: The data type is NUMBER, but IS_NULLABLE is YES, which may not be optimal if RUN_ID is supposed to be a unique identifier.

COLUMN_NAME: EMP_ADDRESS_PC
Issue: The column name suggests it should contain addresses, but the sample data is missing or unclear. Verify if the data type and content are appropriate.

COLUMN_NAME: PC_NAME
Issue: The data type is TEXT, but it appears to represent a code (e.g., PC-004). Consider using a more specific data type or format for codes.

COLUMN_NAME: ANSWER
Issue: The column contains values with varying formats (e.g., "important?", "Very", "999999"). Ensure consistency in the data format if they represent different categories or types.

COLUMN_NAME: QUESTION
Issue: The maximum length is set to 500, but ensure this accommodates all possible question lengths. Adjust if necessary based on data analysis.

COLUMN_NAME: FILE_NAME
Issue: Ensure the TEXT data type is appropriate for storing filenames. If filenames have a specific format or pattern, consider validating or constraining the input.

Semantic Analysis:
Based on the provided sample data and metadata, an analysis was conducted to identify any discrepancies between the semantic meaning of the column names and the data they hold. Additionally, the analysis checked for Snowflake-specific data type optimizations. Here are the identified issues:

1. **Column Name: VERSIONNUMBER**
   - **Issue:** The metadata indicates this is a NUMBER column, but the sample data shows "Six", which is not a numeric value.

2. **Column Name: VERSIONFLAG**
   - **Issue:** The metadata indicates this is a TEXT column with a maximum length of 100. The sample data contains a numeric value "-1.0", which might not align with expected textual semantic meaning.

3. **Column Name: MUID**
   - **Issue:** The metadata indicates this is a TEXT column with a maximum length of 36. The sample data shows a UUID-like string, which is valid; ensure the length does not exceed 36 characters.

4. **Column Name: VERSION_ID**
   - **Issue:** The metadata indicates this as a NUMBER, but the sample data shows "5.0", which is a float. Verify if a NUMBER type should be used for floating-point numbers or if a more appropriate type like FLOAT is necessary.

5. **Column Name: NAME**
   - **Issue:** The metadata indicates this is a TEXT column with a maximum length of 500. The sample data contains "Inactive", which is valid text but should be verified for length consistency.

No further issues were found based on the provided data. Ensure that the data type specified in the metadata aligns with the data stored, especially when dealing with mixed types like TEXT and NUMBER.
