Processing table DAILYSALES with 65 columns
Total rows: 5

Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : sales_data
solution : Correct negative values in columns 'PRDQTY' and 'SALNETAMT'. Ensure 'PRDQTY' reflects actual product quantities. Verify calculations for 'SALNETAMT' and adjust as needed.

column name : SALESMANNAME
solution : Encrypt or mask to comply with PII, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2. Suggest using deterministic encryption or tokenization.

column name : SALESROUTENAME
solution : Mask to protect sensitive business information. Suggest using format-preserving masking.

column name : PRDBATCDE
solution : Mask to protect batch identification. Suggest using randomization masking.

column name : DLVBOYNAME
solution : Encrypt or mask to comply with PII, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2. Suggest using deterministic encryption or tokenization.

column name : FILE_NAME
solution : Mask to protect file integrity and confidentiality. Suggest using substitution masking.

SQL Query:
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    sales_data
WHERE 
    PRDQTY < 0 
    OR SALNETAMT < 0 
    OR PRDNETAMT != (PRDGROSSAMT - PRDSPLDISCAMT - PRDSCHDISCAMT - PRDCASHDISCAMT - PRDDBDISCAMT + PRDTAXAMT);
```

This output identifies the specific anomalies within the `sales_data` table, provides solutions for correcting these issues, and suggests appropriate data masking techniques for sensitive fields. The SQL query is designed to flag records where negative quantities or amounts exist or where calculations do not tally, ensuring data integrity.
Semantic Analysis:
Sure, let's analyze the sample data and metadata provided:

### Issues Identified:

1. **SALNETAMT**:
   - **Issue**: The value `-1500.000000` seems anomalous for a net amount column, as net amounts are typically non-negative in most contexts.

2. **TIME COLUMNS (Columns 48 and 51)**:
   - **Issue**: These columns appear to contain datetime values, but there might be an opportunity to use a more specific data type like `TIMESTAMP` instead of generic `TEXT`.

3. **FILE NAME COLUMN (Column 53)**:
   - **Issue**: The `file001.txt` value suggests this column could be storing file paths or names, which might benefit from a more descriptive column name or data type adjustment if not already optimized.

### Snowflake-Specific Data Type Optimizations:

- **TEXT columns**: Verify if `VARCHAR` with an appropriate length constraint or `STRING` is being used for text data to optimize storage.
- **NUMERIC columns**: Ensure that numeric columns have appropriate precision and scale defined to optimize storage and performance.

This analysis focuses on identifying potential semantic mismatches and optimizations based on the sample data and metadata provided.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: None of the issues are highlighted in the provided sample data because the sample data doesn't include specific examples of semantic misalignments or data type inefficiencies. However, based on the metadata provided, here are potential considerations:

1. **TEXT Data Type Optimization**: 
   - `SALESROUTECODE` is defined as TEXT with a maximum length of 100. If the actual data does not exceed a shorter length, consider reducing the maximum length for optimization.

2. **Number Data Type Optimization**:
   - All `NUMBER` columns (e.g., `PRDSCHDISCAMT`, `SALFREEQTYVALUE`, `VCPSCHEMEAMOUNT`, etc.) should be checked to see if they can be defined with specific precision and scale to optimize storage and processing.

3. **Variant/Array Columns**: 
   - The sample and metadata do not provide specific details on variant or array columns. If such columns exist, ensure they are used appropriately for semi-structured data and evaluate if they can be simplified.

For other columns or further details, specific data issues or inefficiencies need to be identified through a deeper analysis of the actual dataset and usage patterns.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
WHERE EMP_ADDRESS_PC IS NULL
   OR COP_DATE > CURRENT_DATE()
   OR EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR IS NULL;
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `COP_DATE`
- The data type is `TEXT`, but it should be `DATE` for better semantic alignment and efficient querying.

Issue: `YEARMO`
- The data type is `TEXT`, but it should be `NUMBER` or `VARCHAR` with specific formatting to ensure it represents a valid year and month. The value `99999` is not valid for a year and month format.

Issue: `EMP_ADDRESS_PC` and `EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR`
- These columns contain address values, which could benefit from a structured format, potentially as a `VARIANT` to handle diverse address formats or as separate columns for components like street, city, etc.

Issue: `RUN_ID`
- Although the data type is `NUMBER`, it is not present in the sample data. Ensure it is used correctly or consider omitting it if not necessary.

For better Snowflake optimization, consider using appropriate data types like `DATE` for dates, `VARCHAR` with specific lengths for strings, and `NUMBER` for numeric values. Additionally, consider using `VARIANT` for semi-structured data if needed.

Suggestion for Masking:
- Use data redaction or tokenization to replace sensitive information with placeholders.
```

Semantic Analysis:
Based on the provided data and metadata, here are the identified issues:

1. **VERSIONNUMBER**  
   Issue: The column name suggests a version number, which should be numeric. However, in row 2, the value under this column is 'v47', which appears to be a string rather than a purely numeric value.

2. **VERSION_ID**  
   Issue: The column name indicates it should be a numeric identifier (possibly similar to VERSIONNUMBER), but the metadata shows it as a NUMBER. Ensure that all entries are numeric and consistent with the expected format.

3. **VALIDATIONSTATUS**  
   Issue: The column name suggests a status indicator, yet the metadata indicates it is of TEXT type with a maximum length of 500. This might be excessive if the status values are simple short strings like 'Valid' or 'Invalid'.

4. **LASTCHGVERSIONNUMBER**  
   Issue: In the sample data, the format appears to be a date '2023-02-17', which is inconsistent with the expected numeric type according to the metadata. This discrepancy should be checked for potential data type mismatch or conversion issues.

Ensure these columns are reviewed for consistency between the data type, the actual data, and the semantic meaning implied by their names.

```

Semantic Analysis:
Based on the provided sample data and metadata, here is the analysis:

### Issues Identified:

1. **FETCHEDDATETIME**:  
   - Issue: The data type is `TEXT`, but this column holds datetime values. Consider using `TIMESTAMP` for proper datetime handling and storage efficiency.

2. **AZUREDATETIME**:  
   - Issue: The data type is `TEXT`, but this column holds datetime values. Consider using `TIMESTAMP` for proper datetime handling and storage efficiency.

3. **CDL_DATETIME**:  
   - Issue: The data type is `TEXT`, but this column name suggests it should hold datetime values. Consider using `TIMESTAMP` for proper datetime handling and storage efficiency.

4. **FETCHEDSEQUENCE**:  
   - Issue: The data type is `NUMBER`, but the sample data shows a time value format ("12:00:00"). If this column is intended to store time, consider using a `TIME` or `TIMESTAMP` type.

5. **AZUREFILE**:  
   - Issue: The data type is `TEXT`, but the sample data shows a numerical placeholder (-999.0). Ensure this column aligns with expected data input, or clarify its intended use if it stores numerical data.

### Snowflake-Specific Data Type Optimization:

- Consider revisiting the columns with datetime information and changing their data types from `TEXT` to `TIMESTAMP` to leverage Snowflake's datetime functions and optimizations.
- Review columns storing numerical values as text and adjust to `NUMBER` if applicable to save storage space and improve performance.

6. CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_LEVEL_1_CODE and CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_LEVEL_2_CODE should not be NaN. Validate segmentation codes.
7. ENTERDATETIME and LASTCHGDATETIME should not be NaT. Ensure these timestamps are correctly recorded.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
WHERE ID IS NULL 
   OR MUID IS NULL 
   OR NOT TRY_TO_UUID(MUID) 
   OR VERSIONNUMBER IS NULL 
   OR VERSION_ID IS NULL 
   OR VERSIONFLAG NOT IN ('active', 'inactive') 
   OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK IS NULL 
   OR CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_LEVEL_1_CODE IS NULL 
   OR CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_LEVEL_2_CODE IS NULL 
   OR ENTERDATETIME IS NULL 
   OR LASTCHGDATETIME IS NULL;

column name : MUID
solution : Encrypt MUID as it may contain PII. Use deterministic encryption to allow joins.

column name : ENTERDATETIME
solution : Mask ENTERDATETIME to comply with SOC2 standards. Use dynamic data masking to obfuscate the time component.

column name : LASTCHGDATETIME
solution : Mask LASTCHGDATETIME to comply with SOC2 standards. Use dynamic data masking to obfuscate the time component.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: VERSIONNUMBER
- The column contains negative numbers, which may not align with the expected semantic meaning of a version number being a positive integer.

Issue: VALIDATIONSTATUS
- The column contains values "valid" and "invalid", which are text, while it might be more efficient to use a BOOLEAN data type (true/false) for such binary status in Snowflake.

Issue: ID
- The column contains negative numbers, which may not align with the typical expectation of an ID being a non-negative integer.
