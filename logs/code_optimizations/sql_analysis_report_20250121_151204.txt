### Syntax Errors
- **Line 5:** Missing comma after `PEF.WEEK_END_DT` in the `SELECT` clause.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names
- No issues found in terms of missing JOIN/WHERE columns or table names.

### Check for Commas, FROM/WHERE Clause, Proper Join and Case Statements in Nested Subqueries
- **Line 113:** In the nested subquery for `AU_EDW.EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM`, the subquery uses `GROUP BY 1`. While this isn't an error, it is generally better practice to specify the actual column name for clarity.
  
- **Line 144:** In the subquery for `RG_EDW.EDW_GCH_PRODUCTHIERARCHY`, the `LTRIM` function uses `0` as the second argument. Depending on the SQL dialect, this might be intended as a character ('0') or an integer. Ensure that the use of `0` is consistent with the intended SQL dialect's syntax requirements.

- **Line 161:** In the subquery for `AU_EDW.VW_BWAR_CURR_EXCH_DIM`, ensure that the use of `*` is intentional and that all columns returned are necessary for the final `LEFT JOIN`.

No additional issues were found within the nested subqueries regarding commas, FROM/WHERE clauses, proper join, and case statements.
Analyzing and optimizing the provided Snowflake SQL query involves several steps. Here's a detailed breakdown and suggestions for improvement:

### 1. Hardcoded Values Identification

#### Hardcoded Values:

- `'OTHER AURX'`
- `'CHW'`
- `'Other AU Pharmacy'`
- `'Chemist Warehouse'`
- `'APAC'`
- `'USD'`
- `24`

#### Risks and Alternatives:

- **Risks**: Hardcoded values can lead to maintenance challenges and inflexibility as business logic changes. They can also introduce errors if the same value needs to be updated in multiple places.
- **Parameterization/Dynamic Alternatives**: Use variables or configuration tables to manage these values dynamically.

#### Sample Code for Implementation:

```sql
-- Assume these values are stored in a configuration table
WITH Config AS (
    SELECT 'OTHER AURX' AS cust_group_other_aurx,
           'CHW' AS cust_group_chw,
           'Other AU Pharmacy' AS ecomm_cust_other_aurx,
           'Chemist Warehouse' AS ecomm_cust_chw,
           'APAC' AS region_apac,
           'USD' AS currency_usd,
           24 AS months_limit
)

SELECT
  PEF.WEEK_END_DT,
  -- other columns
  CASE
    WHEN UPPER(PEF.CUST_GROUP) = Config.cust_group_other_aurx
    THEN Config.ecomm_cust_other_aurx
    WHEN UPPER(PEF.CUST_GROUP) = Config.cust_group_chw
    THEN Config.ecomm_cust_chw
    ELSE PEF.CUST_GROUP
  END AS ECOMM_CUST,
  -- other columns
FROM AU_EDW.EDW_AU_PHARM_ECOMM_FACT AS PEF
-- continue with other joins and logic
```

### 2. Query Structure Optimization

#### Nested Queries and Subqueries Analysis:

- **Execution Flow**: The query starts with fetching data from `EDW_AU_PHARM_ECOMM_FACT`, followed by joining with `EDW_TIME_DIM`, a filtered `EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM`, a filtered `EDW_GCH_PRODUCTHIERARCHY`, and `VW_BWAR_CURR_EXCH_DIM`.

- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Subqueries in joins, especially duplicate probe ID filtering and hierarchical data filtering, could slow down the execution. 

#### Opportunities for Flattening/Restructuring:

- **Flattening**: Consider using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability and potentially improved optimization by the query planner.

#### Column Usage:

- **`SELECT *` Statements**: Replace with specific column selections if not all columns are needed.
  
- **Unused Columns in JOIN**: Identify columns that are fetched but not used in the final output. For example, columns in `EPPD` and `GCH` not used in the final SELECT can be omitted.

- **Optimized SELECT Example**:

```sql
SELECT
  -- List only the necessary columns
  PEF.WEEK_END_DT,
  ETD.JJ_YEAR,
  EPPD.PROD_KEY,
  PEF.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID,
  -- other required columns
FROM AU_EDW.EDW_AU_PHARM_ECOMM_FACT AS PEF
-- other joins
```

### 3. Join Analysis

- **Join Conditions**: Evaluate necessity and efficiency of each join.
  
- **Unused Columns in JOIN**: Identify and remove unnecessary columns from `EPPD`, `GCH`, and `BWAR`.

- **Join Type Recommendations**: Ensure correct join types are used based on data relationships. For instance, if certain data must exist in both tables, an `INNER JOIN` is more appropriate than a `LEFT JOIN`.

### 4. Performance Enhancement Recommendations

#### Specific Improvements:

- **Coding Standards**: Use clear table aliases and consistent naming conventions.
  
- **Indexes**: Ensure that columns used in JOINs and WHERE conditions are indexed appropriately.

- **Temporary Tables vs. CTEs**: Use CTEs for readability and when the intermediate dataset is small and used multiple times.

- **Materialized Views**: Consider for complex subqueries or frequently accessed data that does not change often.

#### Performance-focused Recommendations:

- **Partitioning**: If the dataset is large, consider partitioning based on date or other logical partitions.

- **Clustering Keys**: Use clustering keys on frequently filtered columns to enhance performance.

- **Query Result Caching**: Enable caching for repeated queries to reduce execution time.

- **Execution Plan Optimization**: Analyze execution plan for potential optimizations, such as eliminating redundant operations or reordering joins.

### Expected Performance Impact and Prioritization:

- **High Priority**: Parameterization of hardcoded values, removal of unused columns, and join optimization.
- **Medium Priority**: Use of CTEs, materialized views, and query result caching.
- **Low Priority**: Coding standard improvements and formatting.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides a structured approach to optimizing the original SQL query. Implementing these changes should improve maintainability, flexibility, and performance.

Source: ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.sql
Analysis Time: 2025-01-21 15:12:44
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Syntax Errors

- **Statement 1:**
  - Missing comma before `TO_DATE(WEEK_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS WEEK_END_DT`.
  - Missing `FROM` keyword before `AU_SDL.sdl_chw_ecomm_data`.

- **Statement 2:**
  - Incorrect reference `ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.WEEK_END_DT`; should specify table alias or a `JOIN` condition is missing.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names

- **Statement 2:**
  - `ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA` is referenced without a table alias or proper join condition.

### Check for Commas, FROM/WHERE Clause, Proper JOIN and CASE Statements in Nested Subqueries

- **Statement 1:**
  - Missing comma between `PERIODID AS TIME_PERIOD` and `TO_DATE(WEEK_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS WEEK_END_DT`.
To optimize and analyze the provided Snowflake SQL query, we'll address each area as requested. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Hardcoded Values Identification

#### Hardcoded Values:
- `'AUD'` as CRNCY
- The date format `'YYYY-MM-DD'` in `TO_DATE(WEEK_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD')`

#### Risks:
- Hardcoded currency can lead to issues if the currency changes or if the system needs to support multiple currencies.
- Hardcoded date formats can lead to issues if date formats need to change or vary by region.

#### Suggestions for Parameterization:
- Use SQL variables or parameters for values that might change or need to be dynamic.

#### Sample Code for Implementation:
```sql
SET CURRENCY = 'AUD';
SET DATE_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM-DD';

CREATE TABLE AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA AS
SELECT
  PFC AS PRODUCT_PROBE_ID,
  SKUNAME AS PRODUCT_NAME,
  NEC1_DESC,
  NEC2_DESC,
  NEC3_DESC,
  BRAND,
  CATEGORY,
  OWNER,
  MANUFACTURER,
  MAT_YEAR,
  PERIODID AS TIME_PERIOD,
  TO_DATE(WEEK_END, :DATE_FORMAT) AS WEEK_END_DT,
  CAST(SALES_ONLINE AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS SALES_VALUE,
  CAST(UNIT_ONLINE AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS SALES_QTY,
  :CURRENCY AS CRNCY,
  FILE_NAME,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS CRT_DTTM,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS UPDT_DTTM
FROM
  AU_SDL.sdl_chw_ecomm_data;
```

### 2. Query Structure Optimization

#### Execution Flow and Bottlenecks:
- **Statement 1**: Creates a table with selected columns. Potential I/O bottleneck due to large data movement.
- **Statement 2**: Deletes records based on a condition. Can be optimized by ensuring indexes on `WEEK_END_DT`.
- **Statement 3**: Inserts all records from a staging table to a target table. Ensure no unnecessary columns are inserted.
- **Statement 4**: Drops the temporary table.

#### Unused Columns and *'SELECT'*:
- The query does not use `SELECT *`, which is good. However, confirm only necessary columns are selected.

#### Optimized SELECT Statement:
- Ensure that only necessary columns are fetched, which appears to be the case here.

### 3. Join Analysis

#### Join Operations:
- There are no explicit JOIN operations in the query. The DELETE operation uses a USING clause which is akin to a JOIN.

### 4. Performance Enhancement Recommendations

#### Coding Standards:
- Use of table aliases is consistent in the `DELETE` operation.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions and indentation for readability.

#### Temporary Tables vs CTEs:
- The use of a temporary table is appropriate here as the data is used across multiple statements.

#### Materialized Views:
- Consider using materialized views if the dataset does not change often and the query is run frequently.

#### Partitioning and Clustering:
- Consider partitioning `ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA` by `WEEK_END_DT` for improved performance on delete and insert operations.
- Clustering keys can be defined on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses.

#### Query Result Caching:
- Ensure Snowflake's automatic caching is leveraged by not altering the same dataset repeatedly within the same session.

#### Execution Plan Optimization:
- Use Snowflake's query profiler to analyze and optimize execution plans.

### Output Requirements

#### Before/After Code Examples:
The sample code provided under parameterization serves as an example of before/after with hardcoded values.

#### Performance Impact:
- Parameterization: Low impact, but increases flexibility.
- Indexing and partitioning: Medium to high impact on performance.
- Use of materialized views: High impact if data doesn't change often.

#### Prioritization of Changes:
- Indexing and partitioning: High priority.
- Parameterization and naming conventions: Medium priority.
- Use of materialized views: Low priority unless specific scenarios demand it.

#### Risks and Dependencies:
- Changes in partitioning or clustering keys may require a large data reorganization.
- Ensure that changes do not disrupt existing processes dependent on the current data structure.

By applying these recommendations, the SQL query should be more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.
