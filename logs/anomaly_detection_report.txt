Semantic Analysis:
```
Issue: FETCHEDSEQUENCE
- The FETCHEDSEQUENCE column appears to represent a sequence value, typically an integer indicating order or position. However, the sample data includes negative values (e.g., -5, -999), which may not align with the usual expectation of a sequence number.

Issue: MAXIMUMORDERQUANTITY
- The MAXIMUMORDERQUANTITY column is expected to represent a maximum allowable quantity for orders. The presence of negative values (e.g., -10.5, -5.0, -100.0) may not make logical sense for a maximum order quantity, which typically should be zero or a positive number.

Table: SDL_JNJ_MER_COP (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
solution : EMP_ADDRESS_PC is missing, update with correct postal code. COP_DATE is one day before START_DATE, verify if intentional or correct it.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
WHERE EMP_ADDRESS_PC IS NULL
   OR COP_DATE >= START_DATE;
```
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
COLUMN_NAME: COP_PRIORITY
Issue: Contains values like "-1" and "Invalid" which do not align with a clear priority level. Expected values should be consistent priority levels such as "Low", "Medium", "High", etc.

COLUMN_NAME: RUN_ID
Issue: Contains negative values like "-101" and "-9999" which might not be valid for an ID column. Typically, IDs are positive integers.

COLUMN_NAME: YEARMO
Issue: Contains values like "99999" which do not match the expected YYYYMM format. The value should be a valid month and year, such as "202312".

COLUMN_NAME: COMPLIANCE

1. Correct the IMPRESSION_COUNT from -100 to a valid non-negative value.
2. Adjust the CAMPAIGN_END_DATE to a date later than or equal to the CAMPAIGN_START_DATE.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_KR_COUPANG_BPA_REPORT
WHERE IMPRESSION_COUNT < 0 
   OR CAMPAIGN_END_DATE < CAMPAIGN_START_DATE;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: DATE
- The data type in metadata is TEXT, but the sample data suggests it should be in DATE format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Issue: CAMPAIGN_START_DATE
- The data type in metadata is TEXT, but the sample data suggests it should be in DATE format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Issue: CAMPAIGN_END_DATE
- The data type in metadata is TEXT, but the sample data suggests it should be in DATE format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Issue: CRTD_DTTM

Table: SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING
solution : Update 'VERSIONFLAG' from 'inactive' to 'active'. Set 'VALIDATIONSTATUS' from 'Invalid' to 'Valid'. Ensure 'ACTIVE' is set to 1.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING
WHERE (VERSIONFLAG = 'inactive' OR VALIDATIONSTATUS = 'Invalid' OR ACTIVE = 0);
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`
- Description: The column name suggests this should be a positive number indicating the version number. However, there is a record with a negative value (`-1`), which may not align with the expected semantic meaning.

Issue: `VERSION_ID`
- Description: Similar to `VERSIONNUMBER`, `VERSION_ID` is expected to be a positive integer uniquely identifying a version. The presence of a negative value (`-1`) may indicate an inconsistency.

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`
- Description: This column is expected to indicate a validation status, typically using values like "Valid" or "Invalid." While the text values appear consistent, ensure that any other potential values align with the intended use.

These issues may need further investigation to confirm whether the values are intended or if they represent data entry errors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
solution : Correct the VERSIONNUMBER from -32 to a valid positive integer representing the correct version. Correct the CHANGETRACKINGMASK from -245 to a valid positive integer reflecting the correct change tracking mask.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION
WHERE VERSIONNUMBER < 0 OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`  
- The column contains some negative values (e.g., -50, -9), which is unusual for a version number as they are typically positive integers.

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`  
- The column contains values 'valid' and 'invalid'. While these are appropriate text indicators, the provided metadata suggests a maximum length of 500 characters, which seems unnecessarily high for such short values. Consider if this is intentional or an oversight.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_PH_CLOBOTICS_SOS_REF
WHERE ENTERDATETIME > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() OR LASTCHGDATETIME > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
```
Semantic Analysis:
Certainly, here are the columns with issues based on the sample data and metadata provided:

1. **MUID**
   - Issue: The value "muid-too-long-for-column-length" exceeds the character maximum length specified (36 characters).

2. **VERSIONNUMBER**
   - Issue: Contains negative value (-2) which may not be semantically valid for a version number.

3. **VERSION_ID**
   - Issue: Contains a negative value (-1) which may not be semantically valid for a version ID.

These columns have data that do not align with their semantic meanings as inferred from their column names and expected data types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_MDS_VN_POS_CUSTOMERS (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_POS_CUSTOMERS
solution : 
1. ID is -1, which is usually reserved for invalid or placeholder records. Replace with a valid unique identifier.
2. VERSIONNUMBER is 0, indicating a possible versioning issue. Ensure correct versioning.
3. VERSION_ID is -5, which may indicate an invalid or placeholder ID. Validate and update with a correct value.
4. CHANGETRACKINGMASK is -999, which is unusual. Validate and correct the value.
5. VALIDATIONSTATUS is Invalid, indicating an issue with the record. Review and correct data inconsistencies.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_MDS_VN_POS_CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = -1 OR VERSIONNUMBER = 0 OR VERSION_ID = -5 OR CHANGETRACKINGMASK = -999 OR VALIDATIONSTATUS = 'Invalid';
```
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: VERSIONNUMBER - Contains an outlier value of 99999 which does not align with the typical increment pattern. Most values increase sequentially by 1, suggesting a potential data entry error.

Issue: ID - Contains a negative value (-1) which is unusual for an ID field that typically only contains positive numbers or zero, indicating a potential data inconsistency.

Issue: VERSION_ID - Contains a negative value (-5), which is inconsistent with the expected positive numbering pattern for version identifiers.

Issue: ENTERVERSIONNUMBER - Contains a negative value (-10) in the first record, which does not align with the increasing sequence seen in the rest of the data. This suggests a potential data entry error.
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: CUST_CUSTOMER (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
Certainly! Here's the output as per your specifications:

```
table_name: CUST_CUSTOMER
solution: The issue detected is that the FETCHEDSEQUENCE value is 0. The FETCHEDSEQUENCE should be a positive integer representing the sequence number of the fetch operation. Update the FETCHEDSEQUENCE to a valid positive integer.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM CUST_CUSTOMER 
WHERE FETCHEDSEQUENCE = 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: FETCHEDSEQUENCE - The expected data type is NUMBER, but presence of negative values may need validation for appropriateness in context. Typically, sequences are expected to be non-negative integers.
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: MRCHR_RESPONSES (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
``` 
table_name : MRCHR_RESPONSES
solution : 
- PRICEDETAILS anomaly: Replace -8.0 with a valid positive price.
- FACINGS anomaly: Replace -1.0 with a valid non-negative number.
- CATEGORYFACINGS anomaly: Replace -6.0 with a valid non-negative number.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM MRCHR_RESPONSES
WHERE PRICEDETAILS < 0 OR FACINGS < 0 OR CATEGORYFACINGS < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `FETCHEDSEQUENCE`  
- The column name suggests it should contain sequential numbers, likely integers. However, there are negative numbers present, which may not align with typical expectations for a sequence.

Issue: `CATEGORYLENGTH`  
- The data type is FLOAT, which is fine, but the presence of negative values might not align with the semantic meaning of "length," as lengths are typically non-negative.

Issue: `CATEGORYFACINGS`  
- Similar to `CATEGORYLENGTH`, the presence of negative numbers in this column might be incorrect, as "facings" typically refer to the number of products visible to a customer and should be non-negative.

Table: SDL_GCPH_BRAND (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_GCPH_BRAND
solution : The 'SUGGESTEDCLASSIFICATIONSCORE' value of 125.0000000000 is outside the expected range for scores. Adjust it to fit within the valid range (e.g., 0 to 100).

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_GCPH_BRAND
WHERE SUGGESTEDCLASSIFICATIONSCORE > 100 OR SUGGESTEDCLASSIFICATIONSCORE < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: TAMR_ID  
- Expected Data Type: NUMBER  
- Sample Data: Includes -1, which may not be a valid ID if IDs are expected to be positive numbers.

Issue: DATEOFEXTRACT  
- Expected Data Type: TEXT  
- Sample Data: "2023-10-10" is a valid date, but as TEXT, it should be consistent with the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

Issue: CDL_DATETIME  
- Expected Data Type: TEXT  
- Sample Data: "2023-10-10 12:00:00" is a valid datetime format, but as TEXT, it should consistently represent datetime as a string.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`  
- The value `-1` in the first row does not align with typical expectations for a version number, which are usually non-negative integers. 

Issue: `MUID`  
- The value `None` in the fourth row is inconsistent with the expectation that `MUID` should be a unique identifier, likely in UUID format. This suggests missing data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_MDS_VN_PS_TARGETS (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_PS_TARGETS  
solution : Negative value detected in 'VALUE' column for ID 48. Ensure 'VALUE' is positive or meets business rules.

SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_PS_TARGETS 
WHERE VALUE < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `ID`
- The sample data includes a negative value (-1), which may not align with the typical use of an identifier that is usually non-negative.

Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER`
- The sample data includes a negative value (-100), which may not align with the expected positive integer values typically associated with version numbering.

Issue: `VERSIONNAME`
- The sample data includes a value of "None", which could be interpreted as missing or null data and may not align with the expectation of a version name being a text string.

Issue: `VERSION_ID`
- The sample data includes a negative value (-5), which may not align with the expected positive integer values typically used for identifiers.

Issue: `VERSIONFLAG`
- The sample data includes a value of "None", which may not align with the expectation of a flag being a defined text or code.

Issue: `ENTERUSERNAME`
- The sample data includes a value of "None", which could be interpreted as missing or null data and may not align with the expectation of a username being a defined text.

Issue: `LASTCHGUSERNAME`
- The sample data includes a value of "None", which could be interpreted as missing or null data and may not align with the expectation of a username being a defined text.

Issue: `VALIDATIONSTATUS`
- The sample data includes values such as "Invalid" and "Valid", which might need clarification on whether these are the only valid statuses or if other statuses are expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_MY_CUSTOMER_DIM (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_MY_CUSTOMER_DIM
solution : The 'ULLAGE' value of 75 is outside expected range. Verify and correct it to the valid range. The 'RDD_IND' value should be 'Y' for active records, but is 'N'. Ensure the 'CDL_DTTM' is accurate and reflects the true status.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_MY_CUSTOMER_DIM 
WHERE ULLAGE NOT BETWEEN <expected_min> AND <expected_max>
   OR RDD_IND != 'Y' AND <condition_to_determine_active>
   OR CDL_DTTM != <expected_datetime_based_on_status>;
```

Note: Replace `<expected_min>`, `<expected_max>`, `<condition_to_determine_active>`, and `<expected_datetime_based_on_status>` with the actual expected values or conditions based on your business rules.
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Column: CUST_ID
Issue: The column is described as holding text data, but it contains numeric IDs. This does not align with the expectation of a customer identifier being represented as text.

Column: ULLAGE
Issue: Although described as text, the data seems to represent numerical values (possibly indicating volume or capacity). This could be better represented as a numeric data type.

Column: TRDNG_TERM_VAL
Issue: The column contains numeric values but is defined as text in the metadata. This suggests a possible misalignment, as trading term values might be better stored as numeric data.

Column: RDD_IND
Issue: The values ('Y' and 'N') suggest a boolean or categorical data type rather than text. This indicates a potential misalignment with the semantic meaning.
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: ITG_SFA_PM (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```
table_name : ITG_SFA_PM

```
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
COLUMN_NAME: SKU_PEOPLE
Issue: The column name suggests it should contain data related to people or individuals associated with SKUs. However, the data appears to be names, which might not align with a specific semantic meaning related to SKU. Further context is needed to determine the intended data.

COLUMN_NAME: SNS_UNITS_SOLD
Issue: The semantic meaning of "units sold" is typically expected to be a numeric value. However, the data type is listed as TEXT, which may not accurately represent numeric data.

COLUMN_NAME: SNS_COGS
Issue: The column name suggests it represents "cost of goods sold," which is typically a numeric value. The data type is TEXT, which might not be appropriate for this type of data.

COLUMN_NAME: AVG_PRODUCT_RATING
Issue: The column name suggests this should be a numeric average rating, but the data type is TEXT, which may not be suitable for storing numeric ratings.

COLUMN_NAME: YEARMO
Issue: The column name suggests it represents a year and month. While the format seems correct, the data type is TEXT, which might not be ideal for date-based operations.

```
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Column: CREATED_DATE
Issue: The data type in the metadata is listed as TEXT, but the values are formatted as dates (e.g., "2023-10-01"). This column should potentially have a DATE data type instead of TEXT.

Column: FILE_UPLOAD_DATE
Issue: The metadata lists the data type as DATE, which is appropriate for the values. However, there are no issues with the column data itself.

Column: CRT_DTTM
Issue: The data type in the metadata is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, which is appropriate for the values (e.g., "2023-10-01 12:00:00"). However, there are no issues with the column data itself.

Semantic Analysis:
```
Issue: YEARMO
- The values in the YEARMO column do not follow a standard year-month format. For example, "202113" and "202199" are not valid representations of a year and month.

Issue: RUN_ID
- The expected data type for RUN_ID is NUMBER, but it contains negative values, which might not be intended if the ID is supposed to be a positive identification number.

Issue: FILE_NAME
- FILE_NAME column contains values like "data1.json", which are strings of file names. There is no explicit issue with the data format, but the presence of ".json" extension should be noted if it was not expected.

Issue: DATA_GRANULARITY
- The DATA_GRANULARITY column contains values like "Daily", "Weekly", and "Monthly". If the column is expected to have a consistent format (e.g., all lowercase), this should be checked, although no explicit formatting issue is visible here.

Table: SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_INVENTORY (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name: SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_INVENTORY  
solution: Anomalous quantity 2000 for DISTRIBUTOR_CODE DIST047, WAREHOUSE_CODE WH047, PRODUCT_CODE PRD047, BATCH_CODE BATCH048. Verify if quantity is correct or if a data entry error occurred, as it appears unusually high.

SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_DISTRIBUTOR_IVY_INVENTORY
WHERE DISTRIBUTOR_CODE = 'DIST047'
  AND WAREHOUSE_CODE = 'WH047'
  AND PRODUCT_CODE = 'PRD047'
  AND BATCH_CODE = 'BATCH048'
  AND QTY = 2000;
```
Semantic Analysis:
```
Column: BATCH_EXPIRY_DATE
Issue: Contains invalid date format (e.g., "abcd-ef-gh") and 'None' values, which are not aligned with expected date values.

Column: QTY
Issue: Contains negative values, which might not align with the semantic meaning depending on the business context (e.g., quantity in stock should not be negative).

Column: DISTRIBUTOR_CODE
Issue: Contains duplicate values (e.g., "DUPLICATE1"), which might not align with the expectation that distributor codes are unique identifiers.
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_DAILYSALES_DEL (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```
table_name: SDL_DAILYSALES_DEL
solution: The anomaly in the row is due to negative values in fields such as SALGROSSAMT (-100.000000), PRDQTY (-5), PRDGROSSAMT (-100.000000), and others. These fields should not contain negative values. Check the data source for errors or apply business logic corrections to ensure these fields have valid positive values.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_DAILYSALES_DEL 
WHERE SALGROSSAMT < 0 
   OR PRDQTY < 0 
   OR PRDGROSSAMT < 0 
   OR SALNETAMT < 0 
   OR PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX < 0 
   OR PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX < 0 
   OR MRP < 0 
   OR NRVALUE < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `SALGROSSAMT`  
- The sample data includes a negative value (-100.000000), which is unexpected for a column that likely represents a gross sales amount. Gross amounts are typically non-negative.

Issue: `MRPCS`  
- The sample data includes a negative value (-1.000000), which is unexpected for a column that likely represents a numerical count or value that should be non-negative.

Issue: `LPVALUE`  
- The sample data includes a negative value (-5.000000), which is unexpected for a column that likely represents a numerical value that should be non-negative.

Table: SDL_DSTR_WOOLWORTH_INV (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_DSTR_WOOLWORTH_INV
solution : 
1. "INV_DATE" should be a valid date format and within an acceptable range. Check the date range.
2. "ARTICLEDESC" should not be None. Ensure that the article description is provided.
3. "LT" value should not be negative. Correct the lead time to a non-negative value.
4. "SL_PERC" should not be negative. Adjust the percentage to a valid range.
5. "SL_MISSED_VALUE" should be zero or more. Verify and correct missed values.
6. "SOH_OMS" should not be negative. Ensure stock on hand reflects actual availability.
7. "SOH_PRICE" should not be negative. Validate and correct the stock price.
8. "AWD_OMS" should not be negative. Check and correct allocation.
9. "DOS_OMS" should not be negative. Verify days of stock.
10. "TOTAL_WHOLESALE_DEMAND_OM" should not be negative. Confirm and rectify demand values.

SQL Query:
SELECT * FROM SDL_DSTR_WOOLWORTH_INV
WHERE INV_DATE IS NULL OR
      ARTICLEDESC IS NULL OR
      LT < 0 OR
      SL_PERC < 0 OR
      SL_MISSED_VALUE < 0 OR
      SOH_OMS < 0 OR
      SOH_PRICE < 0 OR
      AWD_OMS < 0 OR
      DOS_OMS < 0 OR
      TOTAL_WHOLESALE_DEMAND_OM < 0;
```

Semantic Analysis:
```
Column: CONS_DAYS_OOS
Issue: The values are negative, which is unusual for a measure of consecutive days out of stock.

Column: TOTAL_WHOLESALE_DEMAND_OM
Issue: The values are negative, which is unexpected for a total demand metric.

Column: TOTAL_WHOLESALE_ISSUE_OM
Issue: The values are zero across the record, which is unusual for a wholesale issue metric.
```

Table: SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCTS (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```
table_name : SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCTS
solution : 
- STATUS: Correct to a valid status code.
- UNIT_PRICE: Set to a positive value.
- DISPLAY_ORDER: Set to a positive order value.
- LARGEST_UOM_QUANTITY: Set to a positive quantity.
- MIDDLE_UOM_QUANTITY: Set to a positive quantity.
- SMALLEST_UOM_QUANTITY: Set to a positive quantity.
- RUN_ID: Set to a positive value.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCTS
WHERE STATUS < 0 
   OR UNIT_PRICE < 0 
   OR DISPLAY_ORDER < 0 
   OR LARGEST_UOM_QUANTITY < 0 
   OR MIDDLE_UOM_QUANTITY < 0 
   OR SMALLEST_UOM_QUANTITY < 0 
   OR RUN_ID < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue:  
- `UNIT_PRICE`: The `UNIT_PRICE` column is expected to hold positive numerical values representing the price of a unit of the product. However, the sample data shows negative values, which is semantically incorrect for a unit price.
- `DISPLAY_ORDER`: The `DISPLAY_ORDER` column is expected to hold positive numerical values representing the order in which products are displayed. The sample data shows negative values, which is semantically incorrect for an order sequence.
- `STATUS`: The `STATUS` column typically represents a state or condition, often using positive values or specific status codes. The sample data shows negative values, which may not align with typical status representations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_HK_IMS_WINGKEUNG_INV (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_HK_IMS_WINGKEUNG_INV
solution : Negative values in the 'AMOUNT' column are not valid for inventory records. Verify the transaction and adjust the 'AMOUNT' to reflect a positive inventory movement or correct any data entry errors.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM SDL_HK_IMS_WINGKEUNG_INV
WHERE AMOUNT < 0;
```
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: CLOSING - Contains negative values, which may not align with the semantic meaning of 'CLOSING' if it is expected to represent a final or positive quantity.
Issue: AMOUNT - Contains negative values, which may not align with the semantic meaning if it is expected to represent a positive transaction amount.
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_CLAVIS_GB_PRODUCTS (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_CLAVIS_GB_PRODUCTS
solution : Correct 'IS_COMPETITOR' value as it should be 'No' if PRODUCT_ID starts with 'PROD'. Adjust 'AVAIL_STATUS' to a valid status if 'Pre-order' is not applicable. Verify 'OBSERVED_PRICE', 'PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE', and 'DIFF_FROM_PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE' fields for logical consistency and correct if needed. Ensure 'TRAFFIC_PAGE_VIEWS' is realistic for the given product. Check and correct 'MENU_POSITION' as it should be a valid integer.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_CLAVIS_GB_PRODUCTS
WHERE (IS_COMPETITOR = 'Yes' AND PRODUCT_ID LIKE 'PROD%')
   OR AVAIL_STATUS NOT IN ('In Stock', 'Out of Stock', 'Pre-order')
   OR OBSERVED_PRICE - PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE != DIFF_FROM_PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE
   OR DIFF_FROM_PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE_PERCENT != (OBSERVED_PRICE - PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE) / PREV_OBSERVED_PRICE * 100
   OR TRAFFIC_PAGE_VIEWS < 0
   OR MENU_POSITION IS NULL OR MENU_POSITION !~ '^[0-9]+$';
```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: CLIENT_ID - The column contains 'None' value, which may not be expected for a client identifier.

Issue: PRODUCT_ID - The column contains 'None' value, which may not be expected for a product identifier.

Issue: DELETE_IND - The column contains 'Y' and 'N', which are valid, but these should be converted to boolean values for better consistency.

Issue: SALES_CURRENCY_SYMBOL - The column contains currency codes in text format, which aligns with the expected data type. However, ensure that all currency symbols are valid ISO 4217 codes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table: SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_LISTS_PRODUCTS (Chunk 1)
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_LISTS_PRODUCTS
solution : The anomaly is detected due to the incorrect MSL_RANKING value 'rank'. Ensure MSL_RANKING contains valid numerical data.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_POP6_SG_PRODUCT_LISTS_PRODUCTS
WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER(MSL_RANKING) IS NULL;
```
Semantic Analysis:
```
Issue: MSL_RANKING
- Inconsistent data types observed. The column is expected to hold text values, perhaps representing categories or statuses. However, it contains a mix of numeric values (e.g., -1, 9999, 0), text (e.g., 'rank', 'high', 'low', 'abc', 'xyz'), and a decimal (1.5), which could lead to confusion or errors if not properly handled.

Issue: RUN_ID
- Discrepancy in expected data type. The column is expected to hold numeric values, but it includes negative numbers (e.g., -123, -9999) which may not align with typical use cases for an ID. This could indicate an error or require additional context to understand the negative values.
