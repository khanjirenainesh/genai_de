### Syntax Errors
1. **Statement 2**: Missing comma after `PEF.WEEK_END_DT` in the `SELECT` clause.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names
1. **Statement 2**: The alias `PEF` is used for the table `AU_EDW.EDW_AU_PHARM_ECOMM_FACT`, but it's not clear if all columns used from `PEF` are present in the table definition, particularly `PEF.CRNCY`.
2. **Statement 2**: The alias `BWAR` is used for the table `AU_EDW.VW_BWAR_CURR_EXCH_DIM`, but it should be confirmed that the columns `JJ_MNTH_ID` and `FROM_CCY` exist in that table.

### Commas, FROM/WHERE Clause, Proper Join and Case Statements in Nested Subqueries
1. **Statement 2**: Ensure the `GROUP BY 1` in the subquery for `EPPD` correctly corresponds to a valid column. Using `1` typically refers to the first column selected, but "*" is used, so it might be ambiguous.
2. **Statement 2**: Ensure that `LTRIM(MATERIALNUMBER, 0)` and `LTRIM(EPPD.PROD_ID, 0)` are intended to have a second argument of `0`, as this might not be a valid usage depending on the SQL dialect.
Let's analyze the provided Snowflake SQL query based on the areas outlined:

### 1. Hardcoded Values Identification

#### Hardcoded Values:
- `'OTHER AURX'`
- `'CHW'`
- `'Other AU Pharmacy'`
- `'Chemist Warehouse'`
- `'APAC'`
- `'USD'`
- `24`

#### Potential Risks:
- **Maintenance Issues**: Hardcoded values can become outdated or incorrect, requiring changes in multiple places.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Limits the ability to run the same query in different environments or contexts without modification.
- **Security**: Hardcoded values can sometimes expose sensitive information.

#### Suggestions for Alternatives:
- **Parameterization**: Use variables or parameters to allow flexibility and easier maintenance.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Use configuration tables to store these values, which can be updated without altering the query code.

#### Sample Code for Implementation:
```sql
WITH Config AS (
  SELECT 
    'OTHER AURX' AS Other_Aurx,
    'CHW' AS Chw,
    'APAC' AS Region,
    'USD' AS To_Ccy,
    24 AS Month_Limit
)
SELECT ...
FROM ...
LEFT JOIN Config ON 1=1
WHERE
  DATEDIFF(MONTH, PEF.WEEK_END_DT, CURRENT_DATE) <= Config.Month_Limit;
```

### 2. Query Structure Optimization

#### Query Execution Flow:
1. **Create Table**: The main query creates a table from several joined subqueries.
2. **Subqueries**: 
   - Filters duplicate `PRODUCT_PROBE_ID` in `EPPD`.
   - Fetches data from `EDW_GCH_PRODUCTHIERARCHY` for the APAC region.
   - Filters currency exchange rates to USD in `BWAR`.

#### Performance Bottlenecks:
- Subquery for `EPPD` could be optimized if deduplication logic is improved.
- Multiple nested subqueries may slow down execution.

#### Opportunities for Restructuring:
- **Flatten Subqueries**: Use CTEs for better readability and maintainability.
- **Use EXISTS**: Replace `NOT IN` with `NOT EXISTS` for better performance.

#### Alternative Query Structures:
```sql
WITH UniqueEPPD AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM AU_EDW.EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM AU_EDW.EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM AS sub
    WHERE sub.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID = AU_EDW.EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID
    GROUP BY sub.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  )
), GCHData AS (
  SELECT
    MATERIALNUMBER, GCPH_FRANCHISE, ...
  FROM RG_EDW.EDW_GCH_PRODUCTHIERARCHY
  WHERE LTRIM(MATERIALNUMBER, 0) <> '' AND REGION = 'APAC'
), BWARData AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM AU_EDW.VW_BWAR_CURR_EXCH_DIM
  WHERE TO_CCY = 'USD'
)
CREATE TABLE AU_EDW.EDW_PHARMACY_ECOMMERCE_ANALYSIS AS
SELECT ...
FROM AU_EDW.EDW_AU_PHARM_ECOMM_FACT AS PEF
LEFT JOIN AU_EDW.EDW_TIME_DIM AS ETD ON ...
LEFT JOIN UniqueEPPD AS EPPD ON ...
LEFT JOIN GCHData AS GCH ON ...
LEFT JOIN BWARData AS BWAR ON ...
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, PEF.WEEK_END_DT, CURRENT_DATE) <= 24;
```

#### Analyze Column Usage:
- **Select * Usage**: Ensure specific columns are selected rather than using `SELECT *`.
- **Unused Columns in Joins**: Review columns that are joined but not used in the final output. For instance:
  - Columns from `GCH` and `EPPD` should be evaluated for necessity.
- **Optimized SELECT Statements**: Explicitly list only needed columns in the SELECT statement.

### 3. Join Analysis

#### Review JOIN Operations:
- **Join Conditions**: Ensure all join conditions are necessary and correctly implemented.
- **Unused Columns**: Identify and remove columns that are joined but never used.

#### Suggestions:
- Consider using INNER JOIN if data completeness is not an issue and can reduce unnecessary rows.
- Evaluate the need for each LEFT JOIN and replace with INNER JOIN if appropriate.

### 4. Performance Enhancement Recommendations

#### Coding Standards:
- Use meaningful table aliases and consistent naming conventions.
- Ensure proper indentation and formatting for readability.

#### Indexes and Optimization:
- Snowflake does not use traditional indexes; however, clustering keys can be defined.
- Consider temporary tables if the same dataset is reused multiple times for better performance.
- Explore the use of materialized views for frequently accessed complex joins.

#### Performance-Focused Recommendations:
- **Partitioning Strategies**: Not applicable as Snowflake handles partitioning automatically.
- **Clustering Keys**: Consider clustering on frequently filtered columns like `PRODUCT_PROBE_ID` or `JJ_MNTH_ID`.
- **Query Result Caching**: Ensure queries benefit from Snowflake's automatic result caching.
- **Execution Plan Optimization**: Analyze execution plans to identify and address bottlenecks.

#### Expected Performance Impact:
- **High**: Parameterization and restructuring subqueries.
- **Medium**: Join optimization and removal of unnecessary columns.
- **Low**: Code formatting and usage of table aliases.

#### Risks and Dependencies:
- Ensure new code is tested thoroughly to validate that logic has not been altered inadvertently.
- Consider dependencies on existing structures or processes when implementing changes.

The provided refactoring recommendations should help optimize the query in terms of performance and maintainability.

Source: ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.sql
Analysis Time: 2025-01-21 11:31:38
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Syntax Errors

- **Statement 1:**
  - Missing comma after `PERIODID AS TIME_PERIOD`.
  - Missing `FROM` keyword before `AU_SDL.sdl_chw_ecomm_data`.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names

- **Statement 2:**
  - Reference to `ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.WEEK_END_DT` without specifying or aliasing `ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA` in the `DELETE` statement.
Let's analyze the provided Snowflake SQL query in detail, focusing on the specified key areas.

### 1. Hardcoded Values Identification

#### Hardcoded Values in the Query:
- `'AUD'` as currency.
- `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` for both `CRT_DTTM` and `UPDT_DTTM`.

##### Risks Associated with Hardcoded Values:
- **Currency (`'AUD'`)**: Limits flexibility; if the currency changes or varies by context, the query must be altered manually.
- **Timestamp (`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`)**: Using the current timestamp is generally acceptable, but if the requirement changes to use a specific timestamp, the query will need adjusting.

##### Parameterization or Dynamic Alternatives:
- For currency, consider using a parameter or a configuration table to dynamically set the value.
- For timestamps, if future changes might require different timestamps, passing them as parameters can be beneficial.

##### Sample Code for Dynamic Implementation:
```sql
-- Currency dynamically set from a parameter or configuration table
SELECT
  'AUD' AS CRNCY -- Replace this with a dynamic value if needed.
-- Example using a parameter:
-- $currency AS CRNCY

-- Timestamp dynamically passed as a parameter
SELECT
  $current_timestamp AS CRT_DTTM,
  $current_timestamp AS UPDT_DTTM
```

### 2. Query Structure Optimization

#### Nested Queries and Subqueries:
- The sequence of operations involves creating a table, deleting from another table based on a condition, inserting data, and finally dropping the temporary table.

##### Execution Flow:
1. **Create Table**: AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA is created with selected data.
2. **Delete Operation**: Deletes records from AU_ITG.itg_chw_ecomm_data based on matching WEEK_END_DT.
3. **Insert Operation**: Inserts data from AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA into AU_ITG.ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.
4. **Drop Table**: Drops the temporary table AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.

##### Performance Bottlenecks and Opportunities for Optimization:
- **Temporary Table Creation**: The temporary table is created and dropped, which can be optimized using CTEs if the data volume allows.
- **DELETE Operation**: Ensure indexes or appropriate keys are in place to optimize this operation.

##### Alternative Query Structures:
Instead of using a temporary table, consider using a Common Table Expression (CTE) if the data volume is manageable.

```sql
WITH WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA AS (
  SELECT
    PFC AS PRODUCT_PROBE_ID,
    SKUNAME AS PRODUCT_NAME,
    NEC1_DESC,
    NEC2_DESC,
    NEC3_DESC,
    BRAND,
    CATEGORY,
    OWNER,
    MANUFACTURER,
    MAT_YEAR,
    PERIODID AS TIME_PERIOD,
    TO_DATE(WEEK_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS WEEK_END_DT,
    CAST(SALES_ONLINE AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS SALES_VALUE,
    CAST(UNIT_ONLINE AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS SALES_QTY,
    'AUD' AS CRNCY,
    FILE_NAME,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS CRT_DTTM,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS UPDT_DTTM
  FROM AU_SDL.sdl_chw_ecomm_data
)
DELETE FROM AU_ITG.itg_chw_ecomm_data
WHERE WEEK_END_DT IN (SELECT WEEK_END_DT FROM WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA);

INSERT INTO AU_ITG.ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA
SELECT * FROM WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA;
```

#### Column Usage Analysis:
- **SELECT '*' Statements**: Found in the INSERT statement, which can be optimized by selecting only necessary columns.
- **Unused Columns in JOIN**: No JOIN conditions to evaluate.
- **Fetched but Unused Columns**: Ensure only necessary columns are selected, especially in the INSERT statement.

##### Optimized SELECT Statements:
```sql
INSERT INTO AU_ITG.ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA
SELECT
  PRODUCT_PROBE_ID,
  PRODUCT_NAME,
  NEC1_DESC,
  NEC2_DESC,
  NEC3_DESC,
  BRAND,
  CATEGORY,
  OWNER,
  MANUFACTURER,
  MAT_YEAR,
  TIME_PERIOD,
  WEEK_END_DT,
  SALES_VALUE,
  SALES_QTY,
  CRNCY,
  FILE_NAME,
  CRT_DTTM,
  UPDT_DTTM
FROM WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA;
```

### 3. Join Analysis

- No explicit JOIN operations present in the query. The DELETE operation is based on a condition with the temporary table.

### 4. Performance Enhancement Recommendations

#### Coding Standards:
- **Table Aliases**: Use aliases to shorten table names for readability.
- **Indentation and Formatting**: Ensure consistent formatting for better readability.

#### Indexes and Temporary Tables vs CTEs:
- **Indexes**: Ensure WEEK_END_DT is indexed for efficient DELETE operation.
- **CTEs**: Use CTEs for temporary data operations if the data volume is manageable, avoiding the need for a temporary table.

#### Materialized Views and Performance Recommendations:
- **Materialized Views**: Consider them if the dataset is large and frequently queried with similar criteria.
- **Partitioning and Clustering**: Analyze data access patterns to apply suitable strategies.
- **Query Result Caching**: Leverage Snowflake's query result caching to improve performance.
- **Execution Plan Optimization**: Regularly review execution plans to identify optimization opportunities.

### Output Requirements

#### Prioritization:
- **High**: Use of CTEs instead of temporary tables, optimization of DELETE operation.
- **Medium**: Parameterization of hardcoded values.
- **Low**: Formatting and use of aliases.

#### Potential Risks and Dependencies:
- CTEs may not be suitable for very large datasets due to memory constraints.
- Changes in data structure or usage patterns may affect optimization strategies.

Implementing these optimizations can improve the performance, readability, and maintainability of the query while reducing reliance on hardcoded values.
