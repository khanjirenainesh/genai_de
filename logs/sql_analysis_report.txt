### Syntax Errors

- **Line 5**: Missing comma after the column `PEF.WEEK_END_DT`. It should be `PEF.WEEK_END_DT,`.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns or Table Names

- No missing columns or table names were identified.

### Commas, FROM/WHERE Clause, Proper Join and Case Statements in Nested Subqueries

- **FROM Clause**: All subqueries have the `FROM` clause properly defined.
- **WHERE Clause**: All subqueries have the `WHERE` clause properly used where applicable.
- **Commas in Select Statements**: Commas are correctly placed in the select statements of the subqueries.
- **Join Clauses**: Join conditions are properly specified in all `LEFT JOIN` statements.
- **Case Statement**: The `CASE` statement is correctly formatted.

No other issues were detected.
## Data Security & Compliance

### 1. Identify any sensitive data fields:

- `PEF.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID`: This could be a sensitive identifier for products.
- `PEF.CUST_GROUP`: If this field contains customer group information, it could be considered sensitive.
- `PEF.OWNER`, `PEF.MANUFACTURER`: These could potentially contain sensitive business partner information.
- `PEF.SALES_QTY`, `PEF.SALES_VALUE`: These are financial data points.

### 2. Highlight columns that should be masked or encrypted:

- `PRODUCT_PROBE_ID`, `CUST_GROUP`, `OWNER`, `MANUFACTURER`: Potential identifiers or business information.
- `SALES_QTY`, `SALES_VALUE`: Financial information.

### 3. Suggest appropriate masking techniques:

- **PRODUCT_PROBE_ID, CUST_GROUP, OWNER, MANUFACTURER**: Use data masking functions like `MASKING_POLICY` in Snowflake.
- **SALES_QTY, SALES_VALUE**: Aggregate or round values, or apply a masking policy to hide exact numbers.

## Code Quality Analysis

### 1. Identify and list all hardcoded values:

- `'OTHER AURX'`, `'CHW'`, `'Chemist Warehouse'`: These are hardcoded customer group names.
- `'APAC'`, `'USD'`: Region and currency are hardcoded.

### 2. For each hardcoded value:

#### Potential risks:
- Hardcoded values can lead to inflexibility and maintenance challenges if changes are required.

#### Suggest parameterization or dynamic alternatives:
- Use parameters or configuration tables to store these values.

#### Provide sample code for implementation:

For example, using a configuration table for customer group names:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE CUSTOMER_GROUP_CONFIG (
  GROUP_CODE STRING,
  GROUP_NAME STRING
);

-- Populate configuration table
INSERT INTO CUSTOMER_GROUP_CONFIG VALUES ('OTHER AURX', 'Other AU Pharmacy'), ('CHW', 'Chemist Warehouse');

-- Modify query to join on configuration table
LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_GROUP_CONFIG AS CGC
  ON UPPER(PEF.CUST_GROUP) = CGC.GROUP_CODE
```

## Query Structure Optimization

### 1. Review nested queries and subqueries:

#### Map the query execution flow:
- The query runs through left joins, filtering duplicates, and aggregating data from various sources.

#### Identify performance bottlenecks:
- The subquery `EPPD` filtering duplicates can be a bottleneck due to its complexity.

#### Suggest flattening or restructuring opportunities:
- Consider using a CTE for de-duplication to enhance readability and possibly performance.

#### Provide alternative query structures:

```sql
WITH Deduplicated_Products AS (
  SELECT
    *
  FROM AU_EDW.EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM
  WHERE PRODUCT_PROBE_ID NOT IN (
    SELECT PRODUCT_PROBE_ID
    FROM AU_EDW.EDW_PERENSO_PROD_PROBEID_DIM
    GROUP BY PRODUCT_PROBE_ID
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
  )
)
SELECT ...
FROM AU_EDW.EDW_AU_PHARM_ECOMM_FACT AS PEF
LEFT JOIN AU_EDW.EDW_TIME_DIM AS ETD
  ON PEF.WEEK_END_DT = TRUNC(ETD.CAL_DATE)
LEFT JOIN Deduplicated_Products AS EPPD
  ON PEF.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID = EPPD.PRODUCT_PROBE_ID
...
```

### 2. Analyze column usage:

#### Flag any 'SELECT *' statements:
- `EPPD` and `BWAR` subqueries use `SELECT *`.

#### List unused columns in JOIN conditions:
- Check `ETD`, `EPPD`, `GCH`, and `BWAR` for unused columns.

#### Identify columns fetched but not used in final output:
- Review the full list and remove any not present in the final `SELECT`.

#### Provide optimized SELECT statements with specific columns:
- Refactor subqueries to only select necessary columns.

## Join Analysis

### 1. Review all JOIN operations:

#### Evaluate join conditions and their necessity:
- Ensure all join keys are indexed or have efficient execution plans.

#### Identify unused columns from joined tables:
- Only keep columns needed in the final output.

#### Suggest removal of unnecessary joins:
- Validate necessity of each join, particularly for large tables.

#### Recommend appropriate join types:
- Ensure LEFT joins are necessary; consider changing to INNER if applicable.

## Performance Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. Suggest specific coding standards improvements:

#### Table aliases and naming conventions:
- Use meaningful aliases for readability.

#### Proper indentation and formatting:
- Follow consistent formatting for maintainability.

#### Use of appropriate indexes:
- Verify indexing on join keys.

#### Temporary table vs CTE usage:
- Prefer CTEs for readability unless materialized views are beneficial.

#### Materialized view opportunities:
- Consider materialized views for frequently accessed, stable data patterns.

### 2. Provide performance-focused recommendations:

#### Partitioning strategies:
- Partition large tables on date fields for efficient slicing.

#### Clustering keys:
- Use clustering keys to optimize queries with predictable access patterns.

#### Query result caching:
- Enable result caching for repeated queries.

#### Execution plan optimization:
- Review execution plans to identify and address inefficiencies.

## Implementation Priorities

1. **High Priority**:
   - Mask sensitive data fields.
   - Optimize subqueries and joins.

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Parameterize hardcoded values.
   - Review and adjust indexing.

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Formatting and readability improvements.
   - Consider materialized views based on usage patterns.

File: C:\Users\ppahil01\genai_de\data\test\ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.sql
Analysis Time: 2025-01-17 17:19:40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Syntax Errors

- **Statement 1**: Missing comma after `PERIODID AS TIME_PERIOD`.
- **Statement 1**: Missing `FROM` keyword before `AU_SDL.sdl_chw_ecomm_data`.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names

- **Statement 2**: The table `ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA` is referenced in the `WHERE` clause but not specified in the `DELETE` statement or defined in the `FROM` clause.

### Other Errors

- **Statement 1**: Missing semicolon at the end of the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Snowflake SQL query, focusing on data security, code quality, query structure, join operations, and performance enhancement:

### Data Security & Compliance

1. **Identify Sensitive Data Fields:**
   - Based on the column names, potential sensitive data fields might include `PRODUCT_NAME`, `OWNER`, and `MANUFACTURER`. Depending on the business context, these could represent PII or proprietary information.
   
2. **Highlight Columns for Masking or Encryption:**
   - `PRODUCT_NAME`, `OWNER`, and `MANUFACTURER` could be candidates for masking or encryption if they contain sensitive information.

3. **Suggest Masking Techniques:**
   - **PRODUCT_NAME/OWNER/MANUFACTURER:** Use Snowflake's dynamic data masking to hide the actual values. For example:
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE AU_ITG.ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA MODIFY COLUMN PRODUCT_NAME SET MASKING POLICY = 'masking_policy_name';
     ```

### Code Quality Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Values in the View Code:**
   - `'AUD'` as currency
   - `TO_DATE(WEEK_END, 'YYYY-MM-DD')` format
   - `CAST` specifications for `SALES_ONLINE` and `UNIT_ONLINE`
   
2. **Potential Risks and Solutions:**
   - **Risks:** Hardcoded values can lead to inflexibility and maintenance challenges.
   - **Solutions:** Use parameters or configuration tables.
   - **Sample Code:**
     ```sql
     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE CONFIG (PARAM_NAME STRING, PARAM_VALUE STRING);
     INSERT INTO CONFIG VALUES ('CURRENCY', 'AUD');

     SELECT 
       ...,
       (SELECT PARAM_VALUE FROM CONFIG WHERE PARAM_NAME = 'CURRENCY') AS CRNCY,
       ...
     ```

### Query Structure Optimization

1. **Review of Nested Queries:**
   - **Execution Flow:** The query creates a table, deletes records, inserts new records, and drops the table.
   - **Performance Bottlenecks:** Large dataset operations might slow down the `DELETE` and `INSERT` steps.
   - **Opportunities for Restructuring:** Using a CTE for temporary data storage might streamline operations.
   - **Alternative Structure:**
     ```sql
     WITH TEMP_DATA AS (
       SELECT
         PFC AS PRODUCT_PROBE_ID,
         ...
       FROM AU_SDL.sdl_chw_ecomm_data
     )
     DELETE FROM AU_ITG.itg_chw_ecomm_data USING TEMP_DATA AS TEMP
     WHERE TEMP.WEEK_END_DT = ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA.WEEK_END_DT;

     INSERT INTO AU_ITG.ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA
     SELECT * FROM TEMP_DATA;
     ```

2. **Column Usage Analysis:**
   - **'SELECT *' Statements:** Present in statement 3; should specify columns.
   - **Unused Columns:** Determine from business requirements.
   - **Optimized SELECT Example:**
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO AU_ITG.ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA (PRODUCT_PROBE_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, NEC1_DESC, ...)
     SELECT PRODUCT_PROBE_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, NEC1_DESC, ...
     FROM AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_CHW_ECOMM_DATA;
     ```

### Join Analysis

1. **Review of JOIN Operations:**
   - No explicit JOINs are present, but the `USING` clause in the DELETE operation acts similarly.
   - **Unused Columns:** Ensure only necessary columns are used in the `DELETE` condition.
   - **Recommendations:** Evaluate if a simpler condition can be applied.

### Performance Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Coding Standards Improvements:**
   - Use consistent table aliases.
   - Maintain proper indentation and formatting for readability.
   - Consider temporary tables or CTEs for complex operations.

2. **Performance-Focused Recommendations:**
   - **Partitioning and Clustering:** Use partitioning on `WEEK_END_DT` if querying by date range is frequent.
   - **Query Result Caching:** Enable caching if applicable.
   - **Execution Plan Optimization:** Regularly review execution plans for inefficiencies.

### Implementation Priorities

- **High Priority:** Data masking, removing hardcoded values, and optimizing the `SELECT` statements.
- **Medium Priority:** Use of parameters and configuration tables.
- **Low Priority:** Caching and materialized views unless there are known performance issues.

### Potential Risks and Dependencies

- Changes to data masking policies may require business approval.
- Altering table structures or adding indexes might affect existing applications or reports.

This analysis provides a comprehensive approach to improving the original SQL query in terms of security, performance, and maintainability.

### Data Security & Compliance

1. **Sensitive Data Fields Identification:**
   - The query doesn't explicitly list columns in the `SELECT` statement, making it challenging to identify sensitive data fields. However, if any columns in `AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY` or `AU_WKS.WKS_SDL_METCASH_IND_GROCERY` contain sensitive data (like PII, financial data, or PHI), those should be identified by reviewing the schema metadata.

2. **Highlight Columns for Masking/Encryption:**
   - Without specific columns being referenced in the `SELECT *` statement, it's crucial to review table schemas to identify sensitive fields. Typical candidates could be names, social security numbers, credit card numbers, etc.

3. **Suggest Masking Techniques:**
   - **Email addresses**: Use a masking function like `email_mask` to hide portions of email addresses.
   - **SSNs/Credit Card Numbers**: Mask using a function that only displays the last four digits, e.g., `credit_card_mask`.
   - **Names**: Use partial masking, displaying only the first letter or two, e.g., `name_mask`.

### Code Quality Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Values Identification:**
   - `'"'+(String)globalMap.get("f")+'"'` in the third statement is a hardcoded value derived from a global map.

2. **Risks and Alternatives:**
   - **Risks**: Hardcoded values can lead to security vulnerabilities, reduced flexibility, and maintenance challenges.
   - **Alternatives**: Use parameterization to pass dynamic values into the query.
   - **Sample Code**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM AU_WKS.WKS_SDL_METCASH_IND_GROCERY
     WHERE FILE_NAME = ?;
     ```
   - Pass the parameter value dynamically through a prepared statement in the application code.

### Query Structure Optimization

1. **Nested Queries and Subqueries:**
   - **Execution Flow**: The DELETE operation in Statement 1 uses a subquery to identify `WEEK_END_DT` for deletion.
   - **Performance Bottlenecks**: The subquery could be optimized by using a JOIN for better performance.
   - **Restructuring Opportunity**:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM AU_ITG.ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY
     USING AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY
     WHERE AU_ITG.ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY.WEEK_END_DT = AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY.WEEK_END_DT;
     ```

2. **Column Usage Analysis:**
   - **`SELECT *` Statement Flagged**: Present in Statement 2.
   - **Unused Columns in JOIN**: Not applicable in the provided query, as no JOIN is explicitly used.
   - **Optimized SELECT Statement**: Specify only necessary columns instead of using `SELECT *`.

### Join Analysis

1. **JOIN Evaluation:**
   - Not applicable as no explicit JOIN is used in the provided query.

### Performance Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Coding Standards Improvements:**
   - **Table Aliases**: Use aliases for readability.
   - **Formatting**: Ensure consistent indentation and formatting.
   - **Indexes**: Evaluate indexing on `WEEK_END_DT` and `FILE_NAME` columns.
   - **CTE vs Temporary Tables**: Consider using CTEs for complex queries instead of temporary tables unless the temporary table is reused multiple times.

2. **Performance Recommendations:**
   - **Partitioning**: Consider partitioning `AU_ITG.ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY` by `WEEK_END_DT`.
   - **Clustering Keys**: Use clustering keys if the table supports them.
   - **Caching**: Enable query result caching in Snowflake.
   - **Execution Plan**: Analyze and optimize execution plans using Snowflake's query profile.

### Implementation Examples

- **Before**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY;
  ```

- **After**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ..., CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
  FROM AU_WKS.WKS_ITG_METCASH_IND_GROCERY;
  ```

### Priority Ranking and Risks

- **High Priority**:
  - Masking/encryption of sensitive data.
  - Elimination of `SELECT *` for performance and security.
- **Medium Priority**:
  - Query optimization for performance.

```
Analyzing your Snowflake SQL query involves diving into various aspects such as data security, code quality, query structure, join operations, and performance enhancements. Here's a thorough breakdown:

### Data Security & Compliance

1. **Sensitive Data Fields:**
   - Fields like `acct_key` could potentially contain sensitive information (e.g., account numbers).
   - `create_dt` might include timestamps that, while not sensitive by themselves, could be part of a sensitive data set.

2. **Columns to Mask/Encrypt:**
   - **`acct_key`:** Considered sensitive if it is a unique identifier tied to personal or financial information.

3. **Masking Techniques:**
   - **`acct_key`:** Use dynamic data masking or column-level encryption.
     - Example: `ALTER TABLE au_itg.itg_perenso_account_custom_list ALTER COLUMN acct_key SET MASKING POLICY sensitive_masking_policy;`

### Code Quality Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Values:**
   - There are no explicit hardcoded values in this query. However, the table names are fixed.

2. **Parameterization:**
   - **Risks:** Hardcoded table names create rigidity, making the query less adaptable to schema changes.
   - **Solutions:** Use a variable or parameter for table names if the context allows.
     - Example:
       ```sql
       SET table_name = 'au_itg.itg_perenso_account_custom_list';
       DELETE FROM IDENTIFIER($table_name);
       ```

### Query Structure Optimization

1. **Nested Queries and Subqueries:**
   - This query does not contain nested queries, so no performance bottlenecks from such structures exist.
   - Execution Flow: Simple DELETE followed by INSERT.
   - No restructuring necessary here.

2. **Column Usage:**
   - There is no `SELECT *`; all columns are explicitly named.
   - No unused columns are involved in JOINs since there are no JOINs.

### Join Analysis

- **JOIN operations:** There are no JOINs in the provided query, so this aspect isn't applicable.

### Performance Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Coding Standards Improvements:**
   - **Table Aliases and Naming Conventions:** Not applicable here due to absence of JOINs.
   - **Indexing:** Consider index on `acct_key` if it's frequently queried or filtered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Syntax Errors

No syntax errors found.

### Missing JOIN/WHERE Columns, Table Names

No missing JOIN/WHERE columns or table names found.

### Check for Commas, FROM/WHERE Clause, Proper Join and Case Statements in Nested Subqueries

No issues found with commas, FROM/WHERE clause, proper join, and case statements in nested subqueries.
To analyze the provided Snowflake SQL query, we will address each key area separately:

### Data Security & Compliance

1. **Sensitive Data Fields:**
   - The fields in the query appear to be metadata or configuration-related (`field_key`, `field_desc`, `field_type`, `acct_type_key`, `active`, `run_id`, `create_dt`). None of these fields explicitly indicate sensitive data like PII, financial, or health information. However, depending on the context, fields such as `field_key`, `acct_type_key`, and `run_id` might be sensitive if they are keys to sensitive information.

2. **Masking or Encryption:**
   - If `field_key`, `acct_type_key`, or `run_id` are sensitive identifiers, consider masking or encrypting them. Snowflake supports dynamic data masking and external tokenization.
   
3. **Masking Techniques:**
   - Use Snowflake's **Dynamic Data Masking** to mask data at query time.
   - Use **External Tokenization** to store and retrieve sensitive data securely.

### Code Quality Analysis

1. **Hardcoded Values:**
   - There are no explicit hardcoded values in the provided query. However, the table names `au_itg.itg_perenso_account_fields` and `au_sdl.sdl_perenso_account_fields` are specified directly.

2. **Risks and Alternatives:**
   - **Risks:** Direct table references can lead to maintenance issues or errors if table names change.
   - **Alternatives:** Use variables or configuration tables to manage table names dynamically.
   - **Sample Code:**
     ```sql
     SET table_target = 'au_itg.itg_perenso_account_fields';
     SET table_source = 'au_sdl.sdl_perenso_account_fields';

     DELETE FROM IDENTIFIER($table_target);

     INSERT INTO IDENTIFIER($table_target)
     SELECT
       field_key,
       field_desc,
       field_type,
       acct_type_key,
       active,
       run_id,
       create_dt
     FROM IDENTIFIER($table_source);
     ```

### Query Structure Optimization

1. **Nested Queries and Subqueries:**
   - The current query does not have nested queries or subqueries, so no immediate restructuring is necessary.

2. **Column Usage:**
   - No `SELECT *` statement is present.
   - All columns selected are used in the INSERT operation.
   - No unused columns in the join condition since no JOIN is present.

   - `'4130'`, `'8266'`, `'4481'` - Company codes.
   - `'41812332'`, `'41802332'` - Material numbers.
   - `'2023'`, `'2022'` - Fiscal years.

2. **Potential Risks and Alternatives:**
   - **Risks:** Hardcoded values reduce flexibility and require code changes for updates.
   - **Alternatives:** Use parameters or configuration tables.
   - **Sample Code:**

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE process_cogs_data(FISCAL_YEAR STRING, MATERIAL_NUMBERS ARRAY)
   BEGIN
      -- Use these parameters in the query instead of hardcoded values
   END;
   ```

### Query Structure Optimization

1. **Review Nested Queries and Subqueries:**
   - **Execution Flow:** The main query uses several CTEs (`copa`, `stdc`, `emd`, `ecd`, `pac`) that are joined together.
   - **Bottlenecks:** The complexity and depth of joins can introduce performance issues.
   - **Flattening Opportunities:** Consider merging CTEs where possible to reduce complexity.
   - **Alternative Structure:**

   ```sql
   -- Consider creating temporary tables or views for intermediate results
   CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW temp_copa AS
   SELECT ...
   ```

2. **Analyze Column Usage:**
   - **'SELECT *' Statements:** None found; specific columns are selected.
   - **Unused Columns in JOINs:** Some joins might pull extra data not used in the final output.
   - **Provide Optimized SELECT:**

   ```sql
   SELECT copa.fisc_yr, copa.fisc_yr_per, copa.co_cd, ...
   FROM copa
   LEFT JOIN stdc ON ...
   ```

   - **Unused Columns:**
     - Columns in JOIN conditions that aren't used in SELECT statements.

### Join Analysis

1. **Review JOIN Operations:**
   - **Evaluation:** Ensure all JOIN conditions are necessary for the final output.
   - **Unnecessary Joins:** Evaluate if all dimensions (`emd`, `ecd`, etc.) are needed or if they can be simplified.
   - **Join Types:** Consider the business logic for join types; INNER JOIN might be more suitable than LEFT JOIN in some cases.

### Performance Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Coding Standards Improvements:**
   - **Table Aliases:** Ensure consistent and meaningful aliases.
   - **Indexes:** Use appropriate indexes on frequently joined columns.
   - **Temporary Table vs CTE:** Consider using temporary tables for more complex operations.

2. **Performance-Focused Recommendations:**
   - **Partitioning Strategies:** Use partitioning on large tables to improve query performance.
   - **Clustering Keys:** Define clustering keys on columns used in WHERE clauses.
   - **Query Result Caching:** Utilize result caching for frequently run queries.

### Implementation Priorities

- **High Priority:**
  - Masking sensitive data for compliance.
  - Removing hardcoded values for flexibility.

- **Medium Priority:**
  - Optimizing join conditions and removing unnecessary columns.
  - Flattening query structure for improved readability and performance.

- **Low Priority:**
  - Cosmetic coding standards like indentation and table aliases.

### Potential Risks or Dependencies

- **Dependencies on Existing Data Models:** Any changes in the data model or column names will require updates to the query.
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure that performance improvements are tested in a staging environment before deploying to production.
