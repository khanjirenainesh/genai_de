Processing table DAILYSALES with 65 columns
Total rows: 5

Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : transactions
solution : Negative values for SALNETAMT and PRDQTY indicate data entry errors. Ensure all financial transactions have positive amounts unless intentional (e.g., returns).

column name : SALESMANNAME
solution : Considered PII. Mask using hashing or tokenization to comply with GDPR and SOC2.

column name : PRDCODE
solution : Considered sensitive as it might identify specific products. Use data masking techniques like tokenization.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM transactions
WHERE SALNETAMT < 0 OR PRDQTY < 0;
```

Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: Column "SALESMANCODE" appears to hold a mix of numeric and text values, which may not align with its semantic meaning. Consider using a consistent data type.

Issue: Column "SALNETAMT" contains negative values, which may not align with the semantic meaning of net amount. Verify if negative values are expected.

Issue: Column "LCNCODE" has leading zeros in values (e.g., "LCN001"), which may require a data type that preserves formatting, such as TEXT.

Issue: Column "SALROUNDOFFAMT" contains only zero values, which may not provide meaningful data. Verify if this column is necessary or if there's a data entry issue.

Issue: Column "file001.txt" in Column 53 could be a file reference, which may require a different data management approach or a specific data type like TEXT to handle file paths or names consistently.

Issue: DateTime values in columns 48 and 51 are formatted as TEXT. Consider using Snowflake's TIMESTAMP data type for better performance and querying.

Processing Start Time: 12:51:25
Total Records: 5

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : DAILYSALES  
solution :  
- SALNETAMT should not be negative; check calculations and adjust entries.  
- PRDQTY should not be negative; verify stock and correct data entry.  
- PRDGROSSAMT should not be negative; ensure calculations are based on correct PRDQTY and PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX.  
- PRDNETAMT should reflect correct deductions and taxes; review discount and tax calculations.  
- MRP should not be negative; verify pricing data integrity.  
- CREDITNOTEAMT should not be negative; verify and adjust credit note entries.  

SQL Query:  
sql  
SELECT *

   OR CREDITNOTEAMT < 0;  


column name : SALESMANNAME  
solution : Comply with PII standards; mask or encrypt to protect identity.  
suggestion : Use data masking or tokenization for privacy.  

column name : SALESROUTENAME  
solution : Ensure compliance if data contains PII; consider masking.  
suggestion : Apply dynamic data masking to obscure sensitive info.  

column name : DLVBOYNAME  
solution : Protect delivery personnel identity; comply with privacy standards.  
suggestion : Use encryption or data masking techniques.  

column name : PRDCODE, PRDBATCDE  
solution : Consider encryption if data is sensitive for business operations.  
suggestion : Use static data masking or encryption for secure access.
Semantic Analysis:
**Issue:**

1. **SALESROUTECODE**  
   - Data Type: TEXT  
   - Observation: The column holds route codes which may benefit from a more specific data type such as `VARCHAR` with a defined length, especially if codes are short and structured.

2. **VCPSCHEMEAMOUNT**  
   - Data Type: NUMBER  
   - Observation: The column consistently holds a value of 0.000000, which suggests the data might be default or placeholder values. Verify if this aligns with expected data.

3. **NRVALUE**  
   - Data Type: NUMBER  
   - Observation: The column also consistently holds a value of 0.000000. Confirm if this is intended or if further data validation is required.

4. **SALINVNO**  
   - Data Type: Potentially TEXT
   - Observation: Invoice numbers might be better optimized as `VARCHAR` if they have a consistent format or structure.

**Snowflake-Specific Data Type Optimizations:**

1. **DATE/TIMESTAMP Columns (e.g., SALINVDATE, SALDLVDATE, MODIFIEDDATE, CRT_DTTM):**  
   - Consider using `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` for time zone neutrality if time zones are not a concern, which can optimize storage and performance.

Processing table SDL_JNJ_MER_COP with 23 columns
Total rows: 10

Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : Detected anomalies in batch 1
solution : The table contains a single anomalous row with several "None" values indicating missing data. The specific fields with issues are `EMP_ADDRESS_PC`, `SURVEY_NAME`, `SUPERVISOR_NAME`, `COP_PRIORITY`, `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`, `AREA`, `CHANNEL`, and `ACCOUNT`. These fields need to be reviewed for data completeness and accuracy.

column name : EMP_ADDRESS_PC
solution : This field might contain sensitive information if it represents an employee's postal code. Consider masking this field using a format preserving technique.

column name : SUPERVISOR_NAME
solution : This field contains a name, which is considered PII. Apply data masking such as full or partial redaction according to compliance standards like GDPR or SOC2.

column name : ACCOUNT
solution : This could be a sensitive business-related field. Consider using tokenization to protect this information.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM anomalies_batch1
WHERE EMP_ADDRESS_PC IS NULL
   OR SURVEY_NAME IS NULL
   OR SUPERVISOR_NAME IS NULL
   OR COP_PRIORITY IS NULL
   OR START_DATE IS NULL
   OR END_DATE IS NULL
   OR AREA IS NULL
   OR CHANNEL IS NULL
   OR ACCOUNT IS NULL;
```

In the SQL query, we are checking for `NULL` values in the columns identified with missing data. This query will return rows with incomplete information which need to be addressed.
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: EMP_ADDRESS_PC - Data in this column does not appear to align with its intended semantic meaning. It should contain employee address postal codes, but the sample data contains 'None'.
Issue: SUPERVISOR_NAME - This column should contain names, but the sample data contains numeric values like '444'.
Issue: COP_PRIORITY - The data type is TEXT, but contains a value 'Birch' which might not align with the intended priority meaning. Consider validating or renaming the column to reflect its actual content.
Issue: service - Column name is not defined in metadata, which might be a variant or array column. Ensure consistent naming and data type definition.
Issue: important? - Column name is not defined in metadata. Ensure consistent naming and data type definition.

Table: SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
Processing Start Time: 12:51:46
Total Records: 10

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
solution : The 'EMP_ADDRESS_PC' field contains a 'None' value which should be corrected by ensuring that all employee addresses are properly updated in the database. The 'COP_DATE' field seems to be in the future compared to 'START_DATE' and 'END_DATE'; ensure date logic is correct. The 'RUN_ID' value '999999' might indicate a test or placeholder entry, verify and update it with a valid identifier.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
WHERE EMP_ADDRESS_PC IS NULL 
   OR COP_DATE > START_DATE
   OR COP_DATE > END_DATE 
   OR RUN_ID = 999999;

column name : EMP_ADDRESS_PC
solution : This column potentially contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It should be encrypted using a standard such as AES-256 to comply with GDPR and SOC2.

column name : EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR
solution : This column potentially contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It should be masked using dynamic data masking or encrypted to comply with GDPR and SOC2.

column name : SUPERVISOR_NAME
solution : This column potentially contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It should be masked using dynamic data masking or encrypted to comply with GDPR and SOC2.

column name : COP_DATE, START_DATE, END_DATE
solution : Ensure dates are consistent and logically correct, no masking needed.

column name : RUN_ID
solution : Ensure the RUN_ID is a valid identifier and not used as a test placeholder.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: COP_DATE
- The column is defined as TEXT, but it appears to contain date values. Consider using DATE or TIMESTAMP data types for better semantic alignment and query optimization.

Issue: COP_PRIORITY
- The column contains priority levels that could be standardized or categorized. Consider using an ENUM-like feature or a more descriptive column name to align with its semantic meaning.

Issue: YEARMO
- The column represents a year-month combination but is stored as TEXT. Consider using a DATE or custom formatted number for better alignment and validation.

Issue: RUN_ID
- The column contains negative and invalid IDs, which may not align with its intended use. Ensure IDs are positive and unique if used as identifiers.

Issue: EMP_ADDRESS_PC, EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR
- These columns are addresses but are stored as TEXT. Consider using a structured format or JSON/VARIANT for more flexible storage and querying.

Issue: SUPERVISOR_NAME
- The column contains names that could be standardized. Consider using a structured format or ensuring data consistency for better semantic alignment.

Processing table SDL_LA_GT_CUSTOMER with 42 columns
Total rows: 50

Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
Here is the structured solution based on the detected anomalies:

### Anomalies Solution

#### Table: Batch 1

**Column Name:** ACTIVESTATUS  
**Solution:** Replace the anomalous value `-99999` with a valid status code or set to NULL if it is not a recognized status.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
UPDATE <table_name>
SET ACTIVESTATUS = NULL
WHERE ACTIVESTATUS = -99999;
```

### Sensitive Data Compliance

#### Compliance Highlight

**Column Name:** BILLPROVINCE  
**Compliance:** PII, GDPR  
**Solution:** Mask province names to protect user identity.

**Column Name:** BILLZIPCODE  
**Compliance:** PII, GDPR  
**Solution:** Apply partial masking to expose only the first or last few digits.

**Column Name:** LATITUDE  
**Compliance:** GDPR  
**Solution:** Truncate or apply geohashing to reduce precision.

**Column Name:** LONGITUDE  
**Compliance:** GDPR  
**Solution:** Truncate or apply geohashing to reduce precision.

#### Masking Techniques Suggestions

**Column Name:** BILLPROVINCE  
**Masking Technique:** Use a masking function to replace with generic terms like "Province A".

**Column Name:** BILLZIPCODE  
**Masking Technique:** Use partial masking like `MASKING_POLICY(EXPOSE_LAST_3)`.

**Column Name:** LATITUDE  
**Masking Technique:** Use rounding or geohashing.

**Column Name:** LONGITUDE  
**Masking Technique:** Use rounding or geohashing.

### SQL Query for Anomaly Detection

```sql
SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN ACTIVESTATUS = -99999 THEN 'Anomalous'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS AnomalyStatus,
    BILLPROVINCE,
    BILLZIPCODE,
    ACTIVESTATUS,
    LATITUDE,
    LONGITUDE
FROM <table_name>;
```

Replace `<table_name>` with the actual name of your table for the SQL queries.
Semantic Analysis:
**Issues Identified:**

1. **ACTIVESTATUS:**
   - **Issue:** The value `-99999` does not seem semantically correct for an active status indicator, which typically might be a boolean or a predefined set of status codes.

2. **LATITUDE and LONGITUDE:**
   - **Issue:** These columns have a data type of `TEXT`, which is not optimal for storing geographical coordinates. Consider using `FLOAT` to store decimal values.
Table: SDL_LA_GT_CUSTOMER
Processing Start Time: 12:52:21
Total Records: 50

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_LA_GT_CUSTOMER  
solution : Replace -99999 in ACTIVESTATUS with a valid status code. Ensure BILLPROVINCE and BILLZIPCODE contain valid geographical data. Validate and populate ROUTESTEP columns with correct route information. Ensure LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are filled with accurate geographic coordinates. Populate other fields with appropriate business data.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_LA_GT_CUSTOMER
WHERE ACTIVESTATUS = -99999 
   OR BILLPROVINCE IS NULL
   OR BILLZIPCODE IS NULL
   OR LATITUDE IS NULL
   OR LONGITUDE IS NULL
   OR (ROUTESTEP1 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP2 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP3 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP4 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP5 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP6 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP7 IS NULL AND ROUTESTEP10 IS NULL);


column name : BILLPROVINCE  
solution : Mask this column for GDPR compliance. Use partial masking to reveal only the first few characters.

column name : BILLZIPCODE  
solution : Encrypt this column for GDPR compliance. Use deterministic encryption to maintain uniqueness.

column name : LATITUDE  
solution : Mask this column for GDPR compliance. Use geolocation masking to provide a less precise location.

column name : LONGITUDE  
solution : Mask this column for GDPR compliance. Use geolocation masking to provide a less precise location.

column name : FILENAME  
solution : Mask this column for SOC2 compliance. Use hashing to anonymize the file names.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: ARNAME - Some entries contain text that suggests invalid or placeholder values like "None" or "Invalid Name".
Issue: ARADDRESS - Contains entries with "None" which may not align with expected address data.
Issue: TELEPHONE - Contains "None" where a telephone number is expected.
Issue: CITY - Contains "None" or partial information like "City Name" which may not be complete city names.
Issue: DISTRIBUTORID - Contains "None", which may be indicative of missing data where a distributor ID is expected.


### Snowflake-Specific Data Type Optimizations:
1. **TELEPHONE and FAX**: Consider `NUMBER` or a fixed-length `TEXT` for better performance if the format is consistent.
2. **DISTRIBUTORID**: If always numeric and fixed length, consider using `NUMBER` or fixed-length `TEXT`.
3. **CRT_DTTM**: Already optimized as `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`. No further action required.

Processing table SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING with 22 columns
Total rows: 50

Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : batch_1
solution : 
- Ensure ID is not null and is unique.
- Ensure MUID follows UUID format.
- Confirm VERSIONNUMBER matches with VERSION_ID.
- Validate NAME, CODE, CHANGETRACKINGMASK are not null.
- Confirm ACTIVE column is either 'active' or 'inactive'.
- Ensure ENTERDATETIME and LASTCHGDATETIME are valid datetime formats.
- Validate VALIDATIONSTATUS is not null and matches expected statuses.

SQL Query:

   OR NOT TRY_CAST(ENTERDATETIME AS TIMESTAMP) IS NOT NULL
   OR NOT TRY_CAST(LASTCHGDATETIME AS TIMESTAMP) IS NOT NULL
   OR VALIDATIONSTATUS IS NULL;
```

column name : MUID
solution : Mask using PII compliance standards.

column name : ENTERDATETIME, LASTCHGDATETIME
solution : Use dynamic data masking or tokenization for GDPR compliance.

column name : USERNAME fields
solution : Apply hashing or encryption to comply with SOC2 and GDPR standards.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue:  
- `VERSIONNUMBER`: The sample data for "VERSIONNUMBER" shows an integer (47.0), though it is defined as a `NUMBER`. Consider specifying the precision and scale if decimals are not required, as `NUMBER(10,0)`.
- `VERSION_ID`: The sample data for "VERSION_ID" is similar to "VERSIONNUMBER" and may require precision and scale specification.
- `VALIDATIONSTATUS`: The data type is `TEXT` with a max length of 500, but the sample data shows a time value ("12:00:00"), which does not align semantically with the column name. Consider using a more appropriate data type or ensuring the data aligns with the intended use.
- `LASTCHGVERSIONNUMBER`: The sample data shows a date ("2023-02-17") for "LASTCHGVERSIONNUMBER", which is defined as `NUMBER`. The data type may not align semantically if intended to store a date; consider using `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`.
- `ACTIVE`: Defined as `NUMBER`, but no sample data provided. Ensure the values stored are numeric if representing boolean status; consider using `BOOLEAN` for clarity.
- `VERSIONFLAG`: The data type is `TEXT` with a max length of 100, but the sample data shows a status ("inactive"), which might be better suited as an `ENUM` or `BOOLEAN` for active/inactive states.

Processing Start Time: 12:52:50
Total Records: 50

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING
solution : 
1. The 'ID' and 'VERSIONNUMBER' columns have inconsistent types with '24.0' and '47.0'. Convert these to integer types if only whole numbers are expected.
2. The row with all 'NaN' values is likely a data entry error. Review and remove this row if it holds no valid information.
3. Ensure 'ACTIVE' column values are consistent, using integers (0 or 1) or boolean values.
4. 'VALIDATIONSTATUS' column has 'NaN', indicating a missing validation status. Update with a valid status.

SQL Query:
sql
SELECT *
FROM SDL_MDS_VN_GT_MSL_SHOPTYPE_MAPPING
WHERE 
  (ID LIKE '%.%' OR VERSIONNUMBER LIKE '%.%')
  OR (ID IS NULL AND MUID IS NULL AND VERSIONNAME IS NULL)
  OR ACTIVE IS NULL
  OR VALIDATIONSTATUS IS NULL;


column name : MUID
solution : Considered sensitive under GDPR as it may uniquely identify individuals. 

column name : ENTERUSERNAME
solution : Sensitive under PII and GDPR. 

column name : LASTCHGUSERNAME
solution : Sensitive under PII and GDPR.

column name : ENTERDATETIME
solution : Potentially sensitive under GDPR if linked with identifiable data.

column name : LASTCHGDATETIME
solution : Potentially sensitive under GDPR if linked with identifiable data.

Suggestions:
- Use deterministic encryption for 'MUID', 'ENTERUSERNAME', and 'LASTCHGUSERNAME' to maintain uniqueness while protecting data.
- Mask 'ENTERDATETIME' and 'LASTCHGDATETIME' with date truncation or generalization to reduce precision.

**Note**: Always consult your organization's compliance team to verify these suggestions align with specific legal requirements.

```
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `VERSIONFLAG` - The sample data shows "inactive," which is valid, but ensure that all possible values are well-defined and align with a flag (e.g., "active," "inactive"). Consider using ENUM data type if values are limited.

Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER` - Ensure no floating point values if the version number should strictly be integers.

Issue: `VERSION_ID` - Similar to `VERSIONNUMBER`, ensure values are whole numbers if that's the intended design.

Issue: `ID` - The sample contains a floating-point number (47.0); typically, IDs should be integers. Ensure all IDs are stored as integers.

Issue: `ENTERDATETIME`, `LASTCHGDATETIME` - Confirm these columns consistently store timestamp values in `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` format, considering time zone if necessary.

Issue: `MUID` - Ensure the MUID consistently holds unique identifiers, considering its length (36 characters) for UUIDs.

Snowflake-Specific Optimization: Consider using `VARIANT` or `ARRAY` data types if the data structure is flexible or if nested structures are present, although the current sample does not show such a necessity.

```

Semantic Analysis:
Certainly! Based on the provided data and metadata, here are the columns with issues:

1. **FETCHEDDATETIME**: The data type is `TEXT`, but this column represents a datetime value. It would be more appropriate to use a `TIMESTAMP` or `DATETIME` data type in Snowflake.

2. **AZUREDATETIME**: Similar to FETCHEDDATETIME, this column represents a datetime value but is stored as `TEXT`. Consider using `TIMESTAMP` or `DATETIME`.

3. **CUSTOMERID**: The value seems to be a date (2023-10-19), but the column name suggests it should be an identifier. Ensure the data matches the expected customer ID format.

4. **PHONENUMBER**: Stored as `TEXT` but could be optimized using a formatted string or specific data type for phone numbers if Snowflake supports it.

5. **FETCHEDSEQUENCE**: Stored as `NUMBER`, which aligns with its semantic meaning, but make sure the precision and scale are appropriately defined if necessary (e.g., INTEGER).

6. **EMAIL**: While stored as `TEXT`, consider using a format or validation to ensure this field always contains valid email addresses.

Issue: Data type mismatch and potential data misalignment with column names for FETCHEDDATETIME, AZUREDATETIME, CUSTOMERID, and PHONENUMBER.

column name: AZUREDATETIME
solution: Consider masking the AZUREDATETIME column if it can be used to infer sensitive information about data retrieval timings.

column name: CDL_DATETIME
solution: Consider masking CDL_DATETIME to prevent exposure of data load timings which can be sensitive.

Masking Technique Suggestion:
1. AZUREFILE: Use deterministic encryption to maintain uniqueness after encryption.
2. AZUREDATETIME and CDL_DATETIME: Use a date obfuscation technique such as date shifting by a consistent random offset.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: FETCHEDSEQUENCE
- The FETCHEDSEQUENCE column is defined as NUMBER, but it contains negative values, which might not be expected for a sequence. Validate the business logic for allowing negative values in sequences.

Issue: CATEGORYLENGTH
- CATEGORYLENGTH is defined as FLOAT, which is fine for handling decimal values. However, ensure that negative values are acceptable in the business context, as they might not make sense for a length measurement.

Issue: CATEGORYFACINGS
- CATEGORYFACINGS is defined as FLOAT. Negative values are present, which may not be semantically correct for a facings count. Verify if negative values are meaningful in this context.

Issue: FETCHEDDATETIME, AZUREDATETIME, CDL_DATETIME
- These columns are defined as TEXT, but they hold datetime values. Consider using TIMESTAMP data type in Snowflake for better performance and semantic alignment.

solution : Mask or encrypt this column to comply with GDPR. Use data masking techniques like dynamic data masking.

column name : EAN_UPC
solution : Mask or encrypt this column to comply with SOC2. Use hashing or tokenization techniques.
```

Semantic Analysis:
Here is the analysis based on the provided data and metadata:

**Issue:**

1. **COLUMN_NAME: EAN_UPC**
   - **Issue:** The sample data for `EAN_UPC` appears to be numeric (e.g., `123456789012`), which could be stored as a `NUMBER` or a `VARCHAR` with a specific format. Consider validating the format and data type to ensure consistency and optimization.

2. **COLUMN_NAME: WEIGHT_UNIT**
   - **Issue:** The sample data shows a value of `Kg`, which suggests a categorical data type. Consider using an `ENUM` type if the values are limited to a specific set of weight units.

3. **COLUMN_NAME: TAMR_ID**
   - **Issue:** The sample data shows `-1` which could be a placeholder or an invalid ID. Ensure that this column doesn't contain placeholder values unless intended.

4. **COLUMN_NAME: MANUALCLASSIFICATIONID**
   - **Issue:** The sample data shows a numeric value `100`, but it might be more appropriate to use a `STRING` type if it represents a code rather than a quantity or identifier that will be used in calculations.

No issues were found with the other columns as their data seems to align with the semantic meaning and data types provided in the metadata. Consider reviewing the mentioned issues for data accuracy and optimization.

Issue: ORIGIN_SOURCE_NAME - The sample data contains a 'None' value, which might not align with the expected semantic meaning of a source name. Consider using a more descriptive placeholder if 'None' is valid, or ensure source names are consistently provided.
Issue: ORIGIN_ENTITY_ID - Check for consistent formatting as it represents entities and should have valid identifiers.
Issue: MANUALCLASSIFICATIONPATH - Ensure that the paths are correct and align with expected classification hierarchies.
Issue: CDL_DATETIME - The data type is TEXT; consider using TIMESTAMP for date-time values for better performance and storage efficiency in Snowflake.
Issue: DATEOFEXTRACT - The data type is TEXT; consider using DATE for date values for better performance and storage efficiency in Snowflake.

Total rows: 51

Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
```plaintext
table_name : batch_1
solution : 
1. Correct negative values in 'COUNTRY_CODE' and 'sales channel_id'.
2. Ensure 'sales channel_code' aligns with valid entries.
3. Rectify 'srp' and 'usd' amounts, ensuring they are non-negative and correctly formatted.
4. Verify 'ENTERDATETIME' and 'LASTCHGDATETIME' are accurate and in proper datetime format.
5. Fill missing fields where applicable, such as 'ENTERVERSIONNUMBER'.
6. Cross-verify 'COUNTRY_NAME' with 'COUNTRY_CODE' to ensure consistency.
7. Address negative or anomalous 'VERSION_ID' and 'VERSIONNUMBER'.
8. Align 'VALIDATIONSTATUS' to appropriate status based on data integrity.

```plaintext
column name : COUNTRY_CODE
solution : Apply a check to ensure consistent positive country codes.

column name : sales channel_code
solution : Implement a verification process to ensure codes are valid and exist in reference data.

column name : srp
solution : Regular audits to ensure all prices are non-negative and correctly formatted.

column name : usd
solution : Regular audits to ensure currency values are non-negative and correctly formatted.

column name : ENTERDATETIME, LASTCHGDATETIME
solution : Ensure all datetime fields are correctly formatted and not null.

column name : COUNTRY_NAME
solution : Ensure consistency between COUNTRY_CODE and COUNTRY_NAME.

column name : VERSION_ID, VERSIONNUMBER
solution : Ensure version-related fields are non-negative and valid.

column name : VALIDATIONSTATUS
solution : Align with correct validation statuses based on data integrity.

1. Highlight columns that should be masked or encrypted:
   - column name : MUID
     solution : Mask using SHA-256 for PII compliance.
   - column name : code
     solution : Use deterministic encryption for GDPR compliance.
   - column name : ENTERUSERNAME, LASTCHGUSERNAME
     solution : Mask using reversible tokenization for SOC2 compliance.
```

Semantic Analysis:
### Issues Identified:

1. **Column Name: VERSIONFLAG**
   - **Issue**: The data value "beta" in the sample data might not align with the expected values for a flag. Typically, flags are expected to have boolean or indicator values, not descriptive strings.

2. **Column Name: MUID**
   - **Issue**: The data type is TEXT with a maximum length of 36. If MUID is intended to be a unique identifier (such as UUID), consider using a more specific data type or validation to ensure it matches the expected format.

3. **Column Name: LASTCHGDATETIME, ENTERDATETIME**
   - **Issue**: These columns are of type TIMESTAMP_NTZ (timestamp without timezone). Ensure that the application logic handles timezones appropriately, as NTZ might cause issues if timezone information is required.

4. **Column Name: ID**
   - **Issue**: In the sample data, the ID has a value of -1.0. If ID is intended to be a unique positive identifier, negative values might be semantically incorrect.

5. **Column Name: VERSIONNUMBER**
   - **Issue**: This column is of type NUMBER and has a NaN value in the sample data. Consider setting constraints to prevent non-numeric or null values if the version number should always be present and numeric.

6. **Column Name: LASTCHGVERSIONNUMBER**
   - **Issue**: Similar to VERSIONNUMBER, this column should also be checked for non-numeric or null values if it's supposed to hold a version number.

### Recommendations for Snowflake-Specific Data Type Optimizations:

- Consider using `VARCHAR` instead of `TEXT` for columns with character data to leverage Snowflake's optimizations.
- Use `NUMBER(38,0)` or `NUMBER(38,10)` for numeric columns where precision and scale are known, to optimize storage and performance.
- Ensure TIMESTAMP columns are using the correct variant (e.g., `TIMESTAMP_TZ` if timezone information is necessary).

solution : Mask or encrypt, compliance standards: GDPR.  
suggestion : Use deterministic encryption or tokenization.  

column name : COUNTRY_CODE  
solution : Mask or encrypt, compliance standards: GDPR.  
suggestion : Use generalization or pseudonymization.  

column name : COUNTRY_NAME  
solution : Mask or encrypt, compliance standards: GDPR.  
suggestion : Use generalization or pseudonymization.  

column name : ENTERUSERNAME  
solution : Mask or encrypt, compliance standards: SOC2, GDPR.  
suggestion : Use hashing or pseudonymization.  

column name : LASTCHGUSERNAME  
solution : Mask or encrypt, compliance standards: SOC2, GDPR.  
suggestion : Use hashing or pseudonymization.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: VERSIONNUMBER
- The VERSIONNUMBER column contains a negative value (-11) which may not be semantically valid for a version number.

Issue: MUID
- The MUID column contains a None value in one of the rows, which could be an issue if it's expected to always have a value.
