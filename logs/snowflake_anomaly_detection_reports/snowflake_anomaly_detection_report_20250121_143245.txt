Chunk 1/1, Batch 1:
Anomaly Analysis:
Based on the issues detected in the provided data, here is a specific solution for the anomalies detected in the Snowflake database, along with suggestions for handling sensitive data and a Snowflake-specific SQL query to identify such anomalies.

### Table Analysis

#### Table Name: SalesData

**Solution for Issues:**
1. **Negative Values:** The column `SALGROSSAMT` should not have negative values as it represents a gross amount. Similarly, `PRDQTY`, `PRDGROSSAMT`, and `SALNETAMT` should not be negative, indicating incorrect data entry or calculation errors. Review and correct these values based on accurate data sources.
2. **Date/Time Issues:** Ensure `SALINVDATE` and `SALDLVDATE` are correctly formatted and logical (e.g., delivery date should not precede invoice date).
3. **PII and Compliance:** Personal data like `SALESMANNAME`, `DLVBOYNAME`, and potentially sensitive fields like `CREDITNOTEAMT` need to comply with data protection laws.

**SQL Query to Identify Anomalies:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM SalesData
WHERE SALGROSSAMT < 0 
   OR PRDQTY < 0 
   OR PRDGROSSAMT < 0 
   OR SALNETAMT < 0 
   OR SALINVDATE > SALDLVDATE;
```

### Compliance and Data Masking

#### Column Name: SALESMANNAME

**Solution for Issues:**
- **Compliance Standard:** GDPR, PII
- **Masking Technique:** Use partial masking or tokenization to protect personally identifiable information.

#### Column Name: DLVBOYNAME

**Solution for Issues:**
- **Compliance Standard:** GDPR, PII
- **Masking Technique:** Implement full masking or pseudonymization to ensure privacy.

#### Column Name: CREDITNOTEAMT

**Solution for Issues:**
- **Compliance Standard:** SOC2
- **Masking Technique:** Use encryption to secure sensitive financial data.

### Masking Techniques in Snowflake

To implement data masking in Snowflake, you can use the `MASKING POLICY` feature. Here is a basic example:

```sql
CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_personal_info 
  AS (val STRING) 
  RETURNS STRING ->
  CASE
    WHEN current_role() IN ('DATA_SCIENTIST', 'ANALYST') THEN val
    ELSE '******'
  END;

ALTER TABLE SalesData MODIFY COLUMN SALESMANNAME SET MASKING POLICY mask_personal_info;
ALTER TABLE SalesData MODIFY COLUMN DLVBOYNAME SET MASKING POLICY mask_personal_info;
```

This approach ensures that only authorized roles can view unmasked data, while other users see masked values.

By addressing these anomalies and implementing data protection measures, you can ensure data accuracy and compliance within the Snowflake database.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : DAILYSALES
solution : 
1. Correct negative values in 'SALGROSSAMT', 'PRDQTY', 'PRDGROSSAMT' which should be positive if representing amounts and quantities.
2. Ensure date fields 'SALINVDATE' and 'SALDLVDATE' are logical; delivery should be after or on the invoice date.
3. Check and correct 'SALNETAMT' to be equal to 'SALGROSSAMT' minus all discounts and deductions, plus taxes and additional charges.

SQL Query:
SELECT * 
FROM DAILYSALES 
WHERE 
(SALGROSSAMT < 0 OR PRDQTY < 0 OR PRDGROSSAMT < 0) 
OR 
(SALDLVDATE < SALINVDATE) 
OR 
(SALNETAMT != (SALGROSSAMT - (SALSPLDISCAMT + SALSCHDISCAMT + SALCASHDISCAMT + SALDBDISCAMT + SALINVLEVELDISCAMT) + SALTAXAMT + SALTOTADDN));

column name : SALINVNO
solution : Consider masking or encrypting this field as it might be used to identify transactions.

column name : SALESMANCODE
solution : Mask or encrypt this field to protect employee identification details with compliance standards like GDPR.

column name : SALNETAMT
solution : Ensure proper validation to avoid data integrity issues.

Suggestions for masking techniques:
- SALINVNO: Use dynamic data masking by showing partial values.
- SALESMANCODE: Use irreversible hash functions to anonymize the data.
Semantic Analysis:
Below are the columns with issues identified from the provided sample data and metadata:

1. **SALINVLINECOUNT**
   - **Issue:** The data type is `NUMBER`, but it should be validated if this count is always non-negative integer values, which aligns with line counts.

2. **MODIFIEDDATE**
   - **Issue:** The data type is `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, which is appropriate for storing timestamps, but ensure that all entries are valid timestamps and consider using `TIMESTAMP_TZ` if time zone information is needed for future analyses.

3. **DATA_TYPE Optimizations**
   - **Issue:** Textual fields such as `PRDBATCDE` have a data type of `TEXT` with a specified `CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH`. Review if `VARCHAR` is more suitable and if length constraints are necessary for performance optimization.
   - **Issue:** For columns like `NRVALUE`, which might be representing monetary values, consider using `NUMBER` with a specified scale and precision to ensure consistency in decimal places.

Please ensure that all other columns with numerical data types have valid numerical entries and that textual data types align with their expected formats.

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
solution : EMP_ADDRESS_PC has a missing value. Ensure all necessary fields are filled. Consider using ETL processes to validate data completeness.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
WHERE EMP_ADDRESS_PC IS NULL OR EMP_ADDRESS_PC = '';

column name : EMP_ADDRESS_PC
solution : Mask or encrypt using compliance standards such as GDPR, SOC2. Suggested masking technique: Use a hashing function for encryption or replace with a fictional but consistent postcode for masking.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `COP_PRIORITY` contains values such as `-1`, `Negative`, `Invalid`, and `None`, which do not align with typical priority levels. 

Issue: `RUN_ID` contains negative numbers such as `-101` and `-9999`, which may not be semantically valid as identifiers.

Issue: `YEARMO` contains values like `99999` and `202299`, which do not conform to a valid YYYYMM format.

**Snowflake-Specific Data Type Optimization:**
- Consider changing the `COP_DATE`, `END_DATE`, and `START_DATE` columns from `TEXT` to `DATE` for better date handling and validation.
- The `YEARMO` column could potentially benefit from being a `NUMBER` data type with constraints to ensure valid YYYYMM format.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM batch_1
WHERE DISTRIBUTORID = -99999
   OR ARNAME IS NULL
   OR ACTIVESTATUS = -99999;
```

Semantic Analysis:
To analyze the sample data against the metadata and identify columns where the data does not align with its semantic meaning, I'll go through each column and highlight any discrepancies or potential issues with data type optimizations. 

### Issues:

1. **ARNAME**: The sample data shows `None`, which is expected to be a name. If consistently None, it could indicate missing data.
   
2. **ARADDRESS**: The sample data shows `None`, which should be an address. If this is consistently None, it could indicate missing information.

3. **TELEPHONE**: The sample data shows `None`, which is expected to be a telephone number. Consistent None values may indicate data issues.

4. **FAX**: The sample data shows `None`, which is expected to be a fax number. Consistent None values may indicate data issues.

5. **CITY**: The sample data shows `None`, which should be a city name. If consistently None, it could indicate missing data.

6. **REGION**: The sample data shows `None`, which is expected to be a region name. Consistent None values may indicate data issues.

7. **ACTIVESTATUS**: The sample data shows `-99999`, which might not align with typical status codes. Consider verifying if this value is appropriate for this column.

### Snowflake Data Type Optimization Suggestions:

- **LONGITUDE** & **LATITUDE**: Currently stored as `TEXT`, consider using `FLOAT` for better precision and performance with geographic data.
  
- **TIMESTAMP_NTZ**: The `CRT_DTTM` column is correctly using `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, which is optimal for timestamps without timezone considerations.

- **NUMBER**: Ensure that the `ACTIVESTATUS` column's usage of `NUMBER` is appropriate for its typical data range and precision.

These issues and optimizations are based on the assumption that the sample data provided is representative. Further investigation may be required to confirm these findings across the entire dataset.

2. `MAXIMUMORDERQUANTITY`: The column contains negative values, which may not align with the typical expectation of a maximum order quantity being positive.

Snowflake-specific data type optimizations:

1. `FETCHEDSEQUENCE`: Consider using `INTEGER` instead of `NUMBER` if the sequence will always be an integer value, which will optimize storage.
   
2. `AZUREDATETIME`, `CDL_DATETIME`, `FETCHEDDATETIME`: Consider using `TIMESTAMP` data type instead of `TEXT` for date-time values for better performance and storage efficiency.

Semantic Analysis:
Issue: `ID` - Contains a UUID which is typically a string; consider using TEXT for this column.

Issue: `VERSIONNUMBER` - Contains a negative number, ensure if negative values are acceptable.

Issue: `VERSION_ID` - Contains a negative value, check if this is valid.

Issue: `NAME` - Contains what seems to be a personal name; consider using a TEXT type.

Issue: `CODE` - Contains a personal surname; review if this is the intended use of the column.

Issue: `ENTERDATETIME`, `LASTCHGDATETIME` - Ensure TIMESTAMP_NTZ is the correct data type, considering timezone requirements.

Issue: `VERSIONFLAG` - Contains status like "active", ensure if TEXT is the appropriate type if there are limited set values.

column name: ENTERUSERNAME  
solution: Mask using a consistent hash function for pseudonymization. (SOC2)

column name: LASTCHGUSERNAME  
solution: Mask using a consistent hash function for pseudonymization. (SOC2)
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: ID  
- The "ID" column contains a negative value (-1), which is unusual for identifiers that typically start from zero or a positive integer.

Issue: VERSIONNUMBER  
- There is an entry with a very high VERSIONNUMBER (99999), which might indicate a data entry error or an anomaly.

Issue: MUID  
- The "MUID" column has UUIDs of expected length (36 characters), but ensure that they are unique across the dataset.

Issue: VERSION_ID  
- The "VERSION_ID" seems to be a sequence but contains negative values, which might be unexpected.

Issue: VERSIONNUMBER  
- The "VERSIONNUMBER" exceeds typical incremental sequence patterns, indicating potential erroneous data entry at certain points.

Issue: ENTERVERSIONNUMBER  
- This column appears to be a sequence, but it contains negative values, which might be unexpected.

Note: For Snowflake-specific optimizations, consider using the VARIANT data type for columns that may contain semi-structured data or require flexibility in data types.

Semantic Analysis:
Certainly! Here's the analysis based on your provided data:

### Issues:

1. **GROSS_WEIGHT**
   - Issue: The value "-5.000" is negative, which is typically not valid for weight.

2. **TAMR_ID**
   - Issue: The value "-1" may be considered invalid if TAMR_ID is expected to be a positive identifier.

3. **DATA_TYPE**
   - Issue: If "DATA_TYPE" is expected to be one of a predefined set of types, verify the validity of "TypeA".

For Snowflake-specific data type optimizations, none of the provided columns seem to benefit from variant/array data types given their current usage. All columns are either `TEXT` or `NUMBER`, which are appropriate for their respective data types.
