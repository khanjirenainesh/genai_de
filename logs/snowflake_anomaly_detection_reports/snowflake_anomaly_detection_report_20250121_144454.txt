### Table-wise Solutions and SQL Queries

#### Table Name: Sales_Transactions
**Solution for Issues:**  
- **SALINVNO/SALINVDATE/SALDLVDATE:** Ensure dates and invoice numbers are consistent and correct. Correct the mismatched date and time formats.
- **SALINVMODE/SALINVTYPE:** Review and correct any incorrect or inconsistent transaction modes and types.
- **SALGROSSAMT:** Correct negative values as they are not logical for gross amounts.
- **PRDCODE/PRDQTY:** Negative quantities should be reviewed and corrected.
- **PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX/PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX:** Ensure selling rates are positive and correctly calculated.
- **PRDGROSSAMT/PRDNETAMT:** Correct negative amounts. Ensure calculations are accurate.
- **CREATEDDATE:** Ensure all dates are valid and correctly formatted.
- **MIGRATIONFLAG:** Verify all migration flags are correct.

```sql
-- SQL Query to Identify Anomalies in the Sales_Transactions Table
SELECT *
FROM Sales_Transactions
WHERE
    SALGROSSAMT < 0 OR
    PRDQTY < 0 OR
    PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX < 0 OR
    PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX < 0 OR
    PRDGROSSAMT < 0 OR
    PRDNETAMT < 0;
```

### Sensitive Data Masking and Encryption Suggestions

#### Column: SALINVNO
**Solution:** This column may contain sensitive transactional information.  
**Compliance:** SOC2  
**Masking Technique:** Use a data masking policy to replace actual values with a masked pattern, such as `INV####`.

#### Column: SALESMANNAME
**Solution:** Protect sales personnel's names from unauthorized access.  
**Compliance:** PII  
**Masking Technique:** Use dynamic data masking to show initials only, e.g., `J.D.`

#### Column: CUSTOMERID
**Solution:** Mask customer identifiers to protect their privacy.  
**Compliance:** PII, GDPR  
**Masking Technique:** Use irreversible hashing or tokenization.

#### Column: PRDCODE
**Solution:** Mask product codes to prevent unauthorized visibility.  
**Compliance:** SOC2  
**Masking Technique:** Use a substitution cipher or tokenization.

These solutions and SQL queries are tailored for identifying and addressing specific anomalies in the Snowflake database, providing a structured approach to data integrity and compliance-related concerns.
Semantic Analysis:
```plaintext
Issue: Column 'SALINVDATE' and 'SALDLVDATE' appear to hold combined date-time rather than just date. Consider using TIMESTAMP_NTZ or TIMESTAMP_TZ for more appropriate data type.
Issue: Column 'SALINVNO' holds invoice numbers, consider TEXT instead of NUMBER for non-numeric identifiers.
Issue: Column 'SALINVTYPE' and 'SALINVMODE' indicate modes/types which are categorical; consider using ENUM or TEXT data type for clarity.
Issue: Column 'SALSPLDISCAMT' appears to be a discount amount, yet the sample shows it as 'None'; check for data entry issues or correct data type if needed.

Table: DAILYSALES
Processing Start Time: 14:45:09
Total Records: 5

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : DAILYSALES
solution : Correct negative values in SALGROSSAMT, PRDQTY, and PRDGROSSAMT. Ensure PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX and PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX are positive. Verify calculation logic for SALNETAMT.

SQL Query:
sql
WITH Anomalies AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM DAILYSALES
    WHERE SALGROSSAMT < 0 
       OR PRDQTY < 0 
       OR PRDGROSSAMT < 0 
       OR SALNETAMT != (SALGROSSAMT - SALTOTDEDN + SALTOTADDN)
       OR PRDSELRATEBEFORETAX <= 0
       OR PRDSELRATEAFTERTAX <= 0
)
SELECT *
FROM Anomalies;


column name : SALINVNO
solution : Mask or encrypt this identifier to comply with PII and SOC2 standards. Use data masking techniques such as hashing or tokenization.

column name : SALESMANNAME
solution : Mask or encrypt this personal information to comply with PII and GDPR standards. Use partial data masking, like showing only initials.

column name : SALNETAMT
solution : Ensure correct calculation and mask the amount as it may be sensitive financial information, complying with SOC2 standards. Use redaction masking, showing only a range or bands.

column name : PRDQTY
solution : Correct negative values and ensure logical consistency. Mask quantities if deemed sensitive for compliance with SOC2 standards. Use randomization techniques if necessary.

column name : CREATEDUSERID
solution : Mask or encrypt this identifier to comply with PII and SOC2 standards. Use tokenization or pseudonymization techniques.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue: 

1. **SALINVNO** - Check if the invoice numbers are consistent and unique across records, as they should represent distinct sales invoices.

2. **SALINVDATE** & **SALDLVDATE** - Ensure that delivery dates are not earlier than invoice dates, as this would indicate a logical inconsistency.

3. **NRVALUE** - Currently holds only zero values. Verify if this is expected, or if there is missing data or incorrect calculation.

4. **VCPSCHEMEAMOUNT** - Similar concern as NRVALUE, as it also contains only zero values. Confirm if this is correct or an issue with data capture.

5. **RUN_ID** - Ensure this column serves its purpose correctly, and there are no duplicates unless intended.

6. **FILE_NAME** - Confirm file names are unique per record to ensure traceability and correctness in data source identification.

Optimization:

1. **DATA_TYPE for TEXT columns** - Consider using VARCHAR for better compatibility and performance in Snowflake, especially if the TEXT type is not leveraged for additional functionalities.

2. **DATE/TIMESTAMP columns** - Ensure DATE or TIMESTAMP types are optimally used instead of generic TEXT for date/time data to leverage Snowflake's date functions and indexing.

These solutions ensure sensitive data is protected while allowing for data analysis in compliance with PII, HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC2 standards.
Semantic Analysis:
Issue:  
- `COP_DATE`: The sample data shows "2023-10-25", which seems to be a date, but the data type is defined as TEXT. Consider using the DATE data type for better optimization and semantic alignment.
- `SUPERVISOR_NAME`: The sample data shows numerical values (444), which typically should be a name. Verify if this is correct or if the column name is misleading.
- `EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR`: The sample data shows a numerical value (4), which typically should be an address or a name. This does not align with the expected data type based on the column name.
- `COP_PRIORITY`: The sample data shows "Birch", which might not align with the concept of priority (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low"). Verify if this data is correct or if there is a misalignment.

Note: Other columns either align correctly with their semantic meaning or do not provide enough sample data to ascertain any misalignment. Consider data type optimizations for columns with numerical data stored as TEXT.
Table: SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
Processing Start Time: 14:45:32
Total Records: 10

Chunk 1/1:
Anomaly Analysis:
table_name : SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
solution : The 'EMP_ADDRESS_PC' column has a missing value and should be checked for data completeness. The 'END_DATE' is the same as the 'START_DATE', which might indicate incorrect data entry for activities spanning multiple days.

SQL Query:
SELECT *
FROM SDL_JNJ_MER_COP
WHERE EMP_ADDRESS_PC IS NULL
   OR END_DATE = START_DATE
   OR (END_DATE < START_DATE);

column name : EMP_ADDRESS_PC
solution : This column contains potentially sensitive employee location information. It should be masked or encrypted according to GDPR and SOC2 standards. Suggest using deterministic encryption to allow joins while keeping data secure.

column name : EMP_ADDRESS_SUPERVISOR
solution : This is also potentially sensitive information subject to GDPR standards. Apply deterministic encryption to maintain privacy while allowing data operations.

column name : SUPERVISOR_NAME
solution : Personal data that falls under GDPR compliance. Use name masking or tokenization to protect identities.

column name : STORE_NAME
solution : Store names may not be sensitive but consider masking if they are linked to personal data in other tables to comply with GDPR.

column name : QUESTION
solution : While not typically sensitive, if linked with personal data, consider applying basic data masking techniques to avoid potential exposure.

column name : ANSWER
solution : Responses should be protected under GDPR, especially if they can be linked to individual employees or customers. Use data masking or tokenization.
Semantic Analysis:
Certainly! Here are the columns with issues based on the provided sample data and metadata:

1. **COP_PRIORITY**: 
   - Issue: Contains values like "-1" and "Invalid" which do not align with typical priority levels such as "High," "Medium," etc. These values do not have semantic alignment with expected priority terms.

2. **RUN_ID**:
   - Issue: Contains negative numbers like "-101" and "-9999," which are unusual for an identifier column typically expected to be a positive integer.

3. **YEARMO**:
   - Issue: Contains values like "99999" and "202299" which do not align with the typical year-month format (e.g., YYYYMM). These appear to be outside the valid range for a year-month representation.

For data type optimization in Snowflake:

- Consider using the `DATE` data type for `COP_DATE` instead of `TEXT` to ensure proper date handling and operations.
- Evaluate the potential use of `ENUM` or `VARIANT` for columns such as `COP_PRIORITY` to handle a wider range of priority values efficiently if variability is expected.

Please review these columns for corrections or potential adjustments to ensure data integrity and semantic alignment.
